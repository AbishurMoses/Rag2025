Mr. M. C. Patten
406 Melver Street
Greenville, South Carolina
Dear Brother Patten:
It was so kind of you to send me a gift of tio suit bags.
These age most practical and will be used a great deal.
I appreciate this very much.
As we go into the new year, we of course do not understand
at this time what blessings will be ours nor what problems
we will have to face. We move ahead with courage and in
the hope that some good may be accomplished. Some of my
reading of late. leads me to be Hieve that time is of the
essence and that our stay on earth will soon be terminated.
We wish somehow it were possible to convey ouE feelings
completely to the students on our campus. Of course we
have many who are serious in their thinking but there are
also many who do not apprehend.
We are very busy at this time endeavoring to finish the
Self-Study program prios to the pending review in March
by the Southern Association. Also it is at this time of
the year that we do our planning for the year to come.
Somehow things will get done even though the days seem
to be shorter and shorter.
We are looking forward to seeing you at the time of the
annual Board Meeting. Again I wisb to thank you sincerely
for your gift of indness.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M, Schneider
Academic Dean
