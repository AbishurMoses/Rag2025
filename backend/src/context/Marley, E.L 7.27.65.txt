Dear Elder Marley:
The senior class is very pleased that you will be able to give the
Commencement Address for the summer graduating class. The
program will be Saturday evening, Auguat 7 at 8:30 p.m. in the
Taberacle-Audtertum.
The class has now decided upon an aim and motto. Their aim is
"A Better World, An Eternal Reward! and their motto is "He Serves
Who Serves HissFellow Man." You may want to build your sermon
around this.
Again we want to thank you for accepting this invitation and shall
look forward to seeing you at that time.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
