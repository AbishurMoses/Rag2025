Date: Juine 28, 1964
From:
Mr. W. H. T'aylor
Dear Jack:
I was wondering if you ever followed through on the Teaching
Certificate for Mr. Jesse Jones of Forest Lake Academy. I would
apprecia te it very much your writing him of the action of the
Academic Policies committee. You will recall that I wrote you
about this some time ago in the spring. Thank you very much for
taking care of this item.
Sincerely, yours,
Dub
