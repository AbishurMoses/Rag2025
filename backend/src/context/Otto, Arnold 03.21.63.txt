Dear Brother Otto:
We are pleased to invite you back to our campus. We know that your
service will be of the highest order.
In making out our summer session program we have taken for granted
that we can use you in the teaching of certain classes. It is our hope
to offer a rather ambitious program this summer, especially in the
field of education. We believe that a number of teachers will be in
and this may very well be one of our largest summer sessions. We
sincerely hope that you will be in a position to teach the following
classes: Fundamentals of Education, 2 hours; Materials and Methods
of Teaching in the Blementary School, 3 hours; and the class in
Practical Home Arts, 2 hours. We feel that we ought to offer a
vocational class of this nature. This will give you a teaching load
of seven hours during the eight weeks session.
The summer session begins with registration the morning of June 10
and ends Friday, August 2 with commencement exercises being
sponsored the eventng of August 3.
Should you have any questions regarding the summer program, please
let us hear from you at your convenience.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
