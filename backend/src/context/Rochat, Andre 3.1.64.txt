Mr. Andre L. Rochat
Box 196
Berrien Springs, Michigan
Dear Andre:
It was good to hear from you and learn of your interest in college
teaching. I w8s not aware of the fact that you were in Michigan this
year a8 I thought you were plaming to teach in one of our academies
in California. Apparently you changed your plans sometime during the
summer after we left Berrien Springs.
It would be a real pleasure to have you on the staff at Souther Missionary
College. We have been interested for sometime in employing someone to
carry the work here in French. We have been able, however, to secure
the services of Mrs. Victor Lebedoff who will be coming here with her
husband nesxt year. I am sure you are acquainted with the Lebedoffs
since they were in Haitl at the same time that you and Joyce were there.
Victor is completing his doctorate degree in history at the University of
Maryland and his wife is working toward her master's degree in French.
Consequently, we will not be in need of any addittonal help in that area.
Doctor Clyde Bushnell and Miss Olive Westphal are both teaching Spanish
here and are meeting the need in that area. We are interested, however,
in someone who could teach German. M something else should open up
here, I would be very happy to suggest your name as a possibility. At
the present time I don't belleve there will be any openings in the Religion
Department. I will also pass your name along to my colleagues in other
colleges should they write inquiring for names of personnel to teach
French or Spanish.
I trust things will work out for you satisfactorily. Please give our best
regards to Joyce and the family. If you folks are ever down this way, be
sure to stop in and see us.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
