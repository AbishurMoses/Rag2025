Plainfield Academy
Redfield, South Dakota
Dear Mr. Paul:
The matter you propose in your letter of December 31 was discussed
at a recent meeting of the Academic Policies Committee. It was felt
that it would be impossible for us to approve the program you outline.
We do not feel that we could lapprove any practice teaching program
other than that which is offered by our department of education.
Consequently, Iwould suggest that you either plan to return here
during a summer session to complete these requirements or transfer
your credits to Union College and do the work there.
Please understand that we are not unsympathetic with your problem
but our Regional Accrediting Association and the Tennessee Depart-
ment of Bducation would not permit us to fallow this procedure.
IE there is any other way that we may be of assistance to you, please
feel free to contact us.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
