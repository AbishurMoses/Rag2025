Dear Brother Shankel:
I am inclosing herewith a letter sent to the deans of all our
colleges. This speaks for itself. From my study since returning
from Europe a year ago, I an convinced that I can not only be
helpful to such
in planning their trips but as soon as I
can get established bedup think I can save them money. At least for
the present I can arzange these trips as reasonable as anyone
with the hope of doing better a little later.
Hope
are felling better than when you visited us last
Spring. 7 was really worried about you then.
I see by reports that the S. M. C. is getting off to a good
start this year. Hope they don't work you too hard. Give our
regards to Mrs. Shankel, Harvey and Virginia-Cene. They seem
to have crossed us off their lists of correspondence. Did
Virginia-Gene get into the N. E. Conservatory?
Trusting all is well, I am,
Yours very sincerely,
hli
.
