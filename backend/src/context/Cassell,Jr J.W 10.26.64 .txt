Dear Jim:
In accordance with our telephone conversation we are asking Elder
Bruce Johnston to conduct your fall week of prayer. Since Blder Johnston
has an appoinhment in Washington Sunday night, it would not be possible
for him to be on your campus until sometime Monday morning. Con-
sequently, he can begin the series in chapel Monday and continue through
the Sabbath service November 14.
Elder Johnston is making a fine contribution to our program here at
Southern Missionary College and I feel confident that he will be an
asset to both you, your faculty. and your students during your week
of prayer. He is very pleased to have the opportunity to accept the
invitation. I am glad it was possible for us to work this out for you.
If we can be of further service, please feel free to contact us.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
