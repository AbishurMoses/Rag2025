Collegeda: le, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Rees :
You were e yery kind to write me concerning my. visit and talk before
the convocation at Southern Missionary College. I thoroughly
enjoyed my visit and really appreciated the opportunity to talk
with your students.
I will be very glad to return and speak to some additional
classes and note your suggestion of Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays. It is not too difficult for me to find a Monday or
Friday which would enable me to visit your college as you suggest.
If I may, be of service in meeting with any classes, I will be
very happy to work out a schedule with you.
Sincerely,
