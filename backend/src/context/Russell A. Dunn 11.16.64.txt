Dear Mrs. Dunn:
I was very sorry to receive your letter and learn of the problems
you and your family are currently facing. I assure you I would be
more than glad to excuse Ina from her classes for Ifeel it is very
important that she accompany you on this trip to Minnesota. I
have made an appointment with her for tomorrow morning and
will so inform her.
If I may be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
