Dear Sirs:
I am writing a research paper on higher
education in the United States for one of my
classes and would apprec: iate yaur help. The
main part of my paper is concerned with whether
or not colleges need federal aid for their stu-
dents and if not what othe plan can insure a
higher education for qualified high school grad-
uates. I have heard much of the plan you are
us ing to help your students pay for their ed-
ucation am I am very impressed with it. I would
appreciate a copy of your complete plan if it
is possible for I am concidering it as a basis
for a. national plan.
Have you received any signes of disapproval
from your competitive businesses? Do yau be-
lieve that your plan could be used on a national
scope andiif not why? Do you have any statistics
on how many s tudents who are engaged in your
plan fail courses or show distinctly thnt they
are not working as well as they could in their
c. lasses? I would appreciate any and all infor-
ma.tion on your plan that is available.
Thank you.
Cordially,
Mias abx
P. S. Please send me a copy of yaur college
catalog.
