Rockwe1i, North Carolina
Dear Dr. Lombard:
In reply to your letter of April 21 inquiring into the
possibility of securing a graduate of our medical
secretarial course, I have one name to suggest that
would fisi your need quite we1l I think. The girl is
Joan Dierks who has finished the medical secretarial
course. Her home is in Miami and she was hoping to get
employment dotm that way, but it seems as though there
is no opening at our hospital at this tine So it is
quite possible that she would be interested in going
to North Carolina.
Joan is a quite nice appearing girl, has a nice radiant
smile and has worked in our offices here, and has given
satisfactory service. She will be 21 years of age in
June. Her boyfriend has not finished college yet and I
rather think they will not plan on marriage until he is
finished which I believe wiil be another Ewo years.
I have not talked with her specifically yet, but I know
she is planning to work this next year. She finished
the medical secretarial course last year and decided
to continue possibly looking forward to a degree some-
time in the future, but from the financiai point of
view she finds it necessary to work nesxt year. Her
address, of course, until May 20 will simply be
Southern Missionary College.
Very sincerely yours,
G. B. Shanke1
Academic Dean
