Genti lemen:
We have received the report by Genevieve Bixler and
Leo Simmons entitied "The Regional Project in Graduate
Education and Research in Nursing." On page 149 of this
report e find listed the collegiate programs in nursing
in the Southern Region, 1958-1959.
The fact that ouEr Collegiate School of Nursing is
not listed is perhaps an oversight onour part. Perhaps
you can give us further information in regard to this
matter,
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
