Dear Dean Schneider:
Thank you for your report on the Campus
Representatives expense allowance. I am enclosing
a check for $50.00 to cover your expenses during the
academic year, 1961-62. If you should have any
unexpended balance, please carry it forward.
I assume that you are willing to continue as
our Campus Representative. Please let me know if this
assumption should be incorrect.
Our warm thanks go to you for your service
to the Foundation,
Cordially yours,
