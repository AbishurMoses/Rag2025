Dear Oscar:
Recently I received a letter from Bob Morris at Madison with a
news release he sent to you concerning the new Associate in Science
Nursing Program at Southern Missionary College. Enclosed lyou
will find this news release with some revisions which I think will
bring it more in line with the program as it exist in fact.
I think it should be made clear throughout our publicity of this
program that it is a Southern Missionary College program and not
one sponsored or operated by Madison Hospital. The Tennessee
State Board of Nurses is very sensitive about the old Madison
Program and publicity giving the impression that our new program
there is a cover up for the old program would be extremely disastrous.
I trust you will find this news release,as revised, acceptable for the
Tidings. If you should have any further question, please feel free
to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
