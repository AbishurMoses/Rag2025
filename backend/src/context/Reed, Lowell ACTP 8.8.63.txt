Dear Jack:
Seeing you in Lincoln, Nebraska was like seeing a
established friend. I find the more contacts I have long
with representatives of Seventh Day Adventist
the more respect I have for them.
Schools,
Congratulations, not
Jack, on your new appointment. It did
surprise me at all to learn that you received this
promotion. In my estimation, you are
and I dare say within a few years, I will presidential have the timber
lege of addressing you as "Mr. President."
privi-
Please contact me if I can be of any help to you.
Sincerely,
Obuelt
