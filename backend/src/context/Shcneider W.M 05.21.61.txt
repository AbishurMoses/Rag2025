Dear Mr. and Mrs. Stanger:
We were so pleased to receive your letter and to know of your recent
conversion. As time goes on, you will appreciate Biblical truth more and more.
Of course, we all hope that t soon Jesus will come and we can unite in the song
of victory.
We can sense your anxious feeling about acquiring an education that could
be used in the promuigation of the gospe1. It is an unfortunate thing that in
this 1ife we have to be so very much concerned about monetary factors. There
is one thing for Sure, wherever we are and whatever the circumstances may be,
we can witness for our Lord. We would, of course, be pleased to have you apply
as students of this college, yet we must be very frank in presenting the cost
of attendance.
For one involved in full school work and working approximately 18 hours in
an industry, it would cost about $656.00 in addition to the labor of approximately
$468.00. Inasmuch as you are married, you would, of course, live in the com-
munity and be concerned with the tuition costs only. Should you take
approximately twelve hours of school work, it would cost you a total of $496.00
tuition for the year. If both of you go to schooi, it would be double that
amount. If you take fu1l work, or 16 hours of schoolwork, it would cost you
a total of $608.00 pez person per year for the tuition. In addition to this
you would have your regular living costs of food, rent, etc.
It would be wonderful if some philanthropic individual would underwrite
your progran here at this college. I note your wife of capable of giving
music lessons. Inasmuch as our music faculty is complete, it would be
necessary for her to secure private students from the community, and this may
not be too lucrative. Our college is located in a beautiful valley without
a town or city within ten to eighteen miles.
We assume that you have completed your high school work. If this is not
the case, your age would permit the taking of the Generai Educational Develop-
ment tests in order to qualify for college admission. We are enclosing an
application biank along with an information sheet which you may peruse.
Should you find it possibie to come from a financiai point of view, it wi1l
be necessary, of course, for you to send in the application in advance for

processing.
I, too, am an Oklahoma boy. My home country centers around Okeene,
Oklahoma, which is northwest of Lawton.
I wish I could be more encouraging, but this matter may take time. First
of ai1, you may wish to apply and get all matters cleared academically speaking.
If the way is open academically, then perhaps the Lord will open some way
financially.
Let us hear from you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
