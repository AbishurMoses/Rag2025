Dear Mr. Sweet:
On occasion we are faced with the problem of evaluating the credits
of students transferring from unaccredited colleges. We do not feel
that these individuals should be admitted without first meeting some
academic evaluative criteria. Consequently, I am wondering what the
Southern Association suggests in these cases. Is there a formula or a
test battery for certain criteria that is recommended by the association?
At the present time we are doing this pretty much on an individual basis--
accepting those courses that we feel are college level in addition to asking
these students to pass the A.C.T. program.
We have some question, however, about the validity of this program.
Any information you could share with me on this problem would be
greatly appreciated.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.

Dear Dr. Cassell:
The type of procedure which you outline in your letter
of June 23 is similar to that used by other colleges.
We do feel that individuals from an unaccredited
school should be admitted on an individual basis.
Most college S put them on probation for possibly a
semes ster until they can indicate the quality of work
which they can do. After they have established an
acceptable record, then the grades and cour ses from
the unaccredited school are accepted at or above what-
ever level you decide.
Sincerely your Ss
Gordon W. Sweet
