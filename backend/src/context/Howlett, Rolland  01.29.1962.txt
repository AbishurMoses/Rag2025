Box 191
Watsonville, California
Dear Brother Howlett:
Thank you for your request for the placement folders involving
Sandra Collier and Barbara Duska. We wish folders were avail-
able for these young people, but inasmuch as Southern Missionary
College has not yet developed placement folders, we shall have
to give you the information by way of correspondence.
Miss Sandra Collier plans to be married this spring to a young
man who will be staying with us for another year in order to
give bim time to complete his college program. Sandra will,
therefore, be securing a Job in our community oE with the
College until a year from now.
Barbara Duska is married and of course any plans for her would
have to involve her husband as well. Inasmuch as we do not
know what you have in mind for Barbara Duska, it seould be
difficult to advise you in regard to her qualifications. As
a nurse, Barbara will be able to secure work. anywhere, but I
would hesitate employing her as a member of an academy staff
until she will lhave had time to mature a little more and
peshaps become more stabilized. Barbara has had somewhat of
an erratic past largely because of her mother's experience.
If we can be of any further help to you, please let us hear
from you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
