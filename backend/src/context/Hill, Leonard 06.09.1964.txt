Dear Leonard:
First of all let me apologize for not writing to you immediately after
my return to Southern Missionary College. PHowever, after arriving
back on campus, I found that the feeling here was that ie would be best
to maintain a status quo in the library for the coming school year. The
Board did vote, however, to give the present Hbrarian one year's notice
that the program would have to improve markedly or there would be a
complete shift in personnel.
I also felt after talking with Doctor Hammill that it would be very difiicult
for us to get a call through to you this year anyway.
I do want to share the information with you that you asked for in our
conversation while I was there in Berrien. This year our plan is to
appropriate $7,850 for our departmental book fund and $1, 700 for our
general book funds making a total of $9,550. We will appropriate $2,500
for periodicals, $2, 150 for binding, $800 for the nursing school Hbrary
on the Orlando campus. This will make a total of $15,000 for lbrary
materials. This is an increase of $5, 000 over last year.
It is my opinion that we must rapidly increase our library holdings at
Southern Missionary College. We have made progress but I think we
are going to have to move along very rapidly within the next five years,
not only to keep up with our sister colleges but to provide an excellent
academic program. I have found our Board here to be very cooperative
and willing to put money into the academic program. During this coming
year I intend to closely observe the program here to see if it is meeting
the needs of both faculty and students. It has been my opinion this past
year that there is a lot of improvement needed. One of our problem people
did resign, however, and I look for some improvement in the cataloging
area.
