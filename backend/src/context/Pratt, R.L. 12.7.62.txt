Dear Sir:
Last Sunday while driving along the highway in Alabama
I listened to your provocative sermon in regard to the
conditions of the worla today. Iwould appreciate a copy
of this presentation. You are absolutely right concerning
the chaotic and cancerous condition of our world as it
pertains to the social, the political, and the religious.
Thank you for a copy of this sermon,
Very sincerely yours,
