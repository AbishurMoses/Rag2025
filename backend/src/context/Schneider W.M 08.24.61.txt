Dear Harriet:
During my absence from the campus your material arrived pertaining
to the program plans for nexct year. You have given much thought
to this task and this we very much appreciate. I believe. the
progran proposed fox the fall wi1l be acceptable. I would hope
that the saxaphone group from the Plorida acadeny would not
jazz up the song, "Turkey In The Straw." Your other programs
through the year will, of course, be on a higher cultural level
and this we indeed appreciate. Our students will be justly
proud of the college and the efforts put fozth by you students
in leadership.
It will be nice to welcome a1l of you back to this campus and
to the new ladies home which is just about completed. We are
already housing our friends from the other colleges on second
fioor for the section meetings conducted by the General Confer-
ence Department of Education. You will be pleased with the new
home and I am sure that the girls will be very proud of their
home away from home. We wi1l be seeing you back on the campus
soon.
Very sincereiy yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
