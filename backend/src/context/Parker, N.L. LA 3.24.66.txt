Dear Mr. Parkez:
As director of the placement service, Dr. Rees referred your
recent letter to me.
We only have Ewo graduates who might be qualified to fill the
position which you have open, They are Joyce Cullla and Ann
Swayze. I checked with both of these girls and they seem to
foel that California is a lictle far away.
The other graduates in this department axe either married or
aze plamning to be mairied and would not be interested.
I am sorTy that we camot be more helpful to you in your staf
needs. However, we appreciate your interest in our graduates
and hope that you will keep in touch with us for your futuze needs.
Very sincerely youss,
