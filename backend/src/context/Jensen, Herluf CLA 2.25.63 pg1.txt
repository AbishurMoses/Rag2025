Mr. Herluf L. Jensen, Principal
Cedar Lake Academy
Cedar Lake, Michigan
Dear Mr. Jensen:
We appreciate your interest in our graduates and we certainly could
have recommended Bill Mundy without reservation. Our board invited
Bill to come to this campus for a two-year pexiod to assist in research
and do some teaching. In the long run I understand that Bill is interested
in teaching on the secondary level.
Mr. Robext McCurdy has had some experience teaching in Texas. We
believe that he would do a very fine job on the secondary level, even
though he is rated as an average stndene scholastically speaking.
Bob is a very fine Christian man asd you woald appxeciate working with
him.
Iam sorry that we do not have folders available on our seniors and the
only composite information we can provide is by way of the senior
placement brochure which you have received. You will note, however,
that Bob has taken sufficient education to receive denominational
certification and I assume that he would qualify for state certification
but this will have to be determined by examining his transcript.
Bob has been an assistant as a research man. Bob would be wholesome
and you could certainly depend on him. Since we aze not able to provide
you with a composite placement folder, I shall asic Doctor Kennedy, the
head of our Education Department, to write your in regard to Bob. We
will be happy to furmish you with a transeript should Bob make such a
request. Let us hear from you at anytime and we shall try to satiafy
your needs.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
