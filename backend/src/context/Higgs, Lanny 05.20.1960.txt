Mr. Lanny Higgins
2805 Churn Creek Road
Redding, California
Dear Brother Higgins:
Mr. West, our assistant business manager, has handed me your
letter of May 20 relative to the matter of your continuing your
education at Southern Missionary College.
There are a nunber of questions which I would need to knowe the
answer before I make any clear statement as to what you need.
We need to know the name of the correspondence school as some
schools are in good standing and some are not. We have no
question about accepting credits from our om Home Study
Institute in Washington.
Before considering an application we, of course, have to have
the record of school work in high school to know that the high
school work is satisfactorily taken care of before talking co llege
work. It is all right to finish by correspondence providing the
school is in good standing.
You mentioned you had to leave high school because of religious
reasons. That is rather unusual these days because the school
officials are quite reasonable and willing to make any changes
for Seventh-Day Adventists and usually do not have any classes or
anything like that on Sabbath. I am just wondering what the nature
of the difficulty was that it was ne cessary for you to leave school.
I have explained briefly the routine necessary to apply to get into
college. First, we will need a transcript of your grades you
received and then we would be able to advise you better. Anyone
interested in being a physician has to be sure thet t his high school
work is from a schoo1 of good standings otherwise, they will not
accept it.
If we can have information from you on the points mentioned above,
I think we would be in a position to advise you more inte lligently.
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
