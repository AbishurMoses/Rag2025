Dear Colleagues:
A question has come in as to the correct wording of the first
recommendation on page 5 under the PROGRAM OF STUDIES. The
recommendation reads:
1.
Expansion of the present course offerings over a three-
year period to include the following additional subjects:
Art, Driver Education, Shorthand, Home Economics I and I1,
a third year of Foreign Language, and daily classes in
Health and Physical Education for all students.
The suggested correction would read:
1.
Expansion of the present course offerings over a three-
year period to include the following additional subjects:
Art, Driver Education, Shorthand, Home Economics I and II,
and that study be given to adding a third year of Foreign
Language, and daily classes in Health and Physical Educa-
tion for all students.
We would appreciate having your vote by return mail as to which
way this was agreed.
Sincerely yours,
-
W. A. Howe
Associate Secretary
