Dear Ellsworth:
I appreciate your invitation to attend the Southern Union Bible
Conference this fall, but find that it will be impossible for me to
do 80. I have to attend the American Council on Education Meeting
in Washington, D. C. just prior to this date and would probably
not be back in time to meet with you. I do want to attend a Bible
Conference, however, and hope that it will be possible for me to
do so next year should you be kind enough to invite me.
Should I find it possible to come over for part of the time, I will
try to do sO, but I would not want you to make advance motel
reservations for me since it is rather unlikely that I will be able
to be there at all.
Best wishes to you and your staff as you prepare for this very
important conference.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jz.
