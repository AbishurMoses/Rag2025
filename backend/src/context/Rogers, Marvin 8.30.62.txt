New Carlisle, Ohio
Dear Mr. Rogers:
We were pleased to receive your letter and also the. application
for provisional certificate in the state of Ohio. You wi1l note
that I have signed to certify your standing as an individual of
good moral character, but it is not possible for our registrar
to sign sith the college seal.
In. checking the requirements for certification in the state of
Ohio, we note some items which do not appear on your transcript.
Because of this, it is not possible for BS to certify your
application. It may be that you have takez some of these
professional educational courses elsewhere. If this is true,
it will be necessary for you to consolidate your work with the
state and I am sure that they will accept youix training for
certification purposes.
We hope that you will have no difficulty in securing certification
but you can understand that we cannot sign unless your transcript
meets the requixements of the state of Ohio.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
