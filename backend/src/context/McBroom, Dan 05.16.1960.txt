Dear Mr. McBrocm:
Tt was refreshing to read the copy sent to ae of the letter you
recently wrote to Toctor Shankel in reference to the printing
program at SMC.
I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation
for your contribution to the teaching progran in that area this
year. I simply don't know what we could have done without your help.
You are entirely right in that the printing progran is handicapped
by a lack of equipment as well as space. It is a little hard to
knov just how to go about. strengthening this phase of our industrial
arts offerings. In fact, I should 1ike to see a much greater em-
phasis on all the various phases of industrial arts, printing
included.
After having worked with the program, however, for these five
years, I have been forced to the conclusion that our people, by
and large, are not sufficiently impressed with the efficacy of
this type training for our young people today, particularly on
the college level.
You are right again in recommending the junior and senior yeazs of
as being the most
te
Acodeny
appropria time in the educational experience
of the pupil for training in the salable skills.
So very many of our academy youngsters are leaving school at
graduation time or even before and goins out with no background
of training for a means of obtaining a livelihood. It is not hard
for those of us who are acquainted with the trades to invision
the real value of a chain of technical schools anong our Seventh-
day Adventist systen of education.
I feel confident that the sooner we enliet such a program, the
sooner we shall be able to accommodate a vast element of our
youth who now have no place to turn but to worldly schools for
such training. In the meantime we can continue praying and lend-
ing our influence toward such ends.
Very sincerely yours,
