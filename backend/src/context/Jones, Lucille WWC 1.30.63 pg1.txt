Dear Mrs. Jones:
I note with interest your perplexity regarding the requirement of the
basic health course known to most of us as Health Principles or Health
Principles and Hygiene. This problem has been discussed on every
college campus that I have served. There seems to be no final solution
as to this requirement and who should take it.
At present we, too, are giving consideration to this problem. As of
now, our students are permitted to take two out of the following three
courses: Principles of Education, Health Principles, and Git of
Prophecy. The purpose of this requirement is to introduce the student
to the writings of Mrs. E. - G. White. As you can see, this requirement
does not force the student to take any one of the courses but he has the
privilege of choosing two out of three. This, however, is not satisfactory.
Recently we have given further thought to the problem and have come up
with the ideathat the cousse will be required of all students with the
exception of the mursing group. We plan to change the nature of the course
to provide for two or three week units coverning such areas as mental
heaith, diet and health, physiology, etc. These units will be taught by
professional people trained in the particular areas. We hope in this
manner to make the course more interesting and also vital to the student's
knowiedge regarding himself and his relationship to the entire problem of
health. This is what we are contemplating at present but the committee
has not yet finalized on all aspects of gur heaith program. .
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
