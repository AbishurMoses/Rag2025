Orlando, Florida
Dear Brother Ray:
We are happy that you have registered for graduate work at
Stetson University. Iam sorry that this matter was not taken to
the Board but I see no reason why you cammot continue on this
basis so Iong as your work is covered there on the Orlando campus
and arrangements have been made with Mr. Welch. We hope all
goes well. Should any problems oE: questions arise, please let us
hear from you as you find time to write.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
AÃ§ademic Dean
gl
P.S. M your program involves time off in summer, perhaps we ought
to present that to the Board at the time of our May meeting. Please
Iet us hear from you by that time.
