Dear sir :
For our Youth Guidance class this year we are
writing a term paper. I am writing on the sub-
ject "Why go to a Seventh-day Adventist College?"
Included in the paper will be "why go to college
at all?"
I would like any written material which you could
send'me.. If you are unable to send any such ma-
terial I would appreciate your sending me a state-
ment on "Why go to a Seventh-day Adventist Gollege?"
I would appreciate a S.M:C. catalogue and student
hand book also.
Sincerly yours,
CooblE, fenvs
