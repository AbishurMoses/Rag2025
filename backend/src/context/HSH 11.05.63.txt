Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Doctor Rees:
Larry Leas, advertising manager for Southérn Memories, has
kindly requested that we place in your school year book a
rather large advertisement. We are very happy to do this
and we feel honored to be included among the list of advertisers.
However, we would like to suggest that after January 15 we
be given the same consideration as other organizations of
contacting your graduating class as prospective empl loyees
of Hinsdale Sanitarium and Hospital. Doctor, Schneider last
year declared that we had no right to contact any of these
students until graduation and that he preferred that we make
no visit to the çollege until they had graduated.
We shall be grateful for your cooperation with us when we
come to the college and endeavor to interview your graduating
students for permanent employment in our institution.
Any time that you are up this way, please come see us. We
are anxious to show off this emosiaatiomally-omed hospital.
Very sincerely yours,
MM. Vorout - 6 09
