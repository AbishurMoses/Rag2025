Dear Miss Merrill:
We appreciate your interest in our Collegiate Nursing Program.
Obviously it would be better for you to start your collegiate program
with the freshmen class inasmuch as it is an integrated program.
The courses, however, which you mentioned are all necessary with
the exception of the Elementary Nutrition, two hours, and Elementary
Foods course, one hour. In place of these courses you would be taking
a one-hour class in Social Ethics and a three-hour class in Child Care
and Development. The class in Child Care and Development is necessary
before you would be going to the Orlando campus. The Nutrition is
taught on the Orlando campus.
I am turning your letter over to our Nursing Department for careful
scrutiny and they will write you in the near future. Perhaps they will
be able to outline a completely integrated program which will enable
you to go to our Orlando campus per schedule. We sincerely hope
that you will continue to look foward to this place for your collegiate
program.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schnelder
Academic Dean
