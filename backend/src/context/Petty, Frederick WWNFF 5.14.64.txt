Dear Mr. Petty:
Dean Cassell tells me that you will probably not
graduate this June. We would normally expect to give
you your Woodrow Wilson Fellowship whenever you are
ready but I vant to hear from you in some detail just
exactly what the problems have been. If for reasons
of physical or mental health you have had to reduce
your cour: se load so that you will graduate a summer
session or a summer session plus one or two semesters
later than anticipated, there would be no problem pro-
vided we can get a statement from your doctor to the
effect that you are in good condition to begin graduate
studies when the time comes.
Cordially,
National Director
