SOUTHERN REGIONAL DUCATION BOARD
130 SIXTH STREET, NN. w. ATLANTA 13, GEORGIA TRINITY 5-9811
November 8, 1960
Mr. Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dean Schneider:
I regret the delay in acknowledging your inquiry of October 7 in regard
to the collegiate programs in nursing listed on pp. 149-150 in Bixler
and Simmons, The Regional Project in Graduate Education and Research in
Nursing. We referred your letter to Dr. Bixler, who has been away from
the city for several weeks. Yesterday I had an opportunity to talk with
her by telephone.
Dr. Bixler informs me that the omission of Southern Missionary College
from the list of collegiate programs in nursing was based upon inadequate
information at the time the list was compiled. Rather than an oversight
on your part, it seems to have been one on ours, and we regret it accordingly.
The list was published merely to show the increase in the number of colle-
giate schools of nursing in 1959 as compared with those of the year 1952,
which are also shown on pp. 148-149. It is not intended as a list of
schools "approved" by SREB, since the Southern Regional Education Board
undertakes no accrediting functions.
Sincerely yours,
a - K
Lloyd'W. Chapin
