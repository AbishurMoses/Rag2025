Thank you for your response of June 22. In my previous

receive an additional two copies of the book "On The
History of The American Bankers Association, Its Past and
Present." There are several bankers in Chattanooga,
Tennessee interested in this book and I should Iike to
present them with complimentary copies. If these are
available, would you kindly send them in the near future.
Very sincerely yours,
