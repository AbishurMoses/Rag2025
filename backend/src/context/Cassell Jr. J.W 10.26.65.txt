Dear Wilbert:
Weiare in the process of reviewing our policy regarding the repeating
of courses. At the present time we permit a student who has received
a "C or an "R" in a course to repeat the same course in residence.
We also stipulate that if a student plans to repeat a course, he must
do this prior to taking a more advanced course. In figuring his
grade point average, we then do not include the lower grade in the
BPA.
In many ways we feel this is a rather unrealistic policy and wonder if
it would not be better to include all courses in figuring the GPA. I
believe in almost every case, graduate and professional schools
compute the student's grade point average in this way regardless of
what has been done at the undergraduate level.
Consequently, I would like to know what policy you are presently
following in your institution. It has been argued that it is to the
student's advantage not to include the poorer grade in those courses
he has repeated, but possibly a student' 's academic sins should
follow him regardless. Personally, I am of that opinion, but I did
want to survey my colleagues prior to revising our policy. Your
comments and feelings regarding this matter would be greatly
appreclated in addition to the policy you are presently following.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
