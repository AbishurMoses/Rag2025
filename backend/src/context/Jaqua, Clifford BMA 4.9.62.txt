Lumberton, Mississippi
Dear Mr. Jaqua:
While in North Carolina last week, you inquired about the availability
of an English teacher. Back in February a Mr. Steve Ward of 5801
Kalmia Street, Springfield, Virginia, wrote me indicating an interest
in joining the staff of one of our secondary schools. Mr. Ward was
a student here at S.M.C. from 1957-59. During the last two years of
his college career he attended a state supported school because of
finances. He indicated that there were many advantages that he
missed although he secured a good-paying position in public school.
His B. S. Degree was in Social Studies from the Appalachian State
Teachers College, Boone, North Caroline. He was in the top ten of
a large graduating class. In the field of English he has twenty-
six semester hours which of course are in addition to the Social
studies. He is also qualified to give instruction in driver edu-
cation. He says he feels at hose in the class room and the work
is rewarding but he sould feel much more useful in one of the
boarding academies. Courses in the field of Guidance end Counseling
have stimulated an act of interest In the duties of a dean of boys
as well as a teacher. Last summer he took six graduate courses.
You may be interested in following up on this lead. We hope that
if the young man is interested in teaching in our schools, we will
be able to use him. You mey be interested in knowing that he
canvassed for three summers and his father has been a colporteur
for 19 years in the Carolina Conference, so you can surely appreciate
the rewards of Christian service.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
