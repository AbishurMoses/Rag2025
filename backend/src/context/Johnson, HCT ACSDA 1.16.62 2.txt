If you have opportunity sometime to take some of your holidays in
Alberta, we would be more than delighted to meet you again. Banff is only 80
miles away, with its hot springs the year around, and Lake Louise, with all its
beauty, is just a few miles further on. Should you ever come this way be sure
to contact me and we will be glad to show you around our Province.
Cordially yours,
H. C. T. Johnson
Secretary-Tiasurer
