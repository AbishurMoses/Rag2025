Dear Brother Johnson:
I was glad to hear from you again and learn of your continued interest
in Southern Missionary College. We have been endeavaring to find a
solution to the problem of leadership in our student personnel program
throughout the year. Our plans are still not completely definite, but lt
seems likely that if a change is made, we will probably invite one of
our present teachers to assume the responsibility. I do think it would
be well, however, for you to talk: with Doctor Rees while you are in
the area about your qunlifications and plans.
We area also interested in finding someone to do some teaching at the
collegelevel in secondary education. It might be that you would have
an interest in this field. I am leaving for the Christmas vacation and
will not return until January 3. Consequently, I will not have the
opportunity of talking with you personally. As far as I know, however,
Doctor Rees will be here throughbut the Christmas vacation and I am
sure he would be most happy to talk with you should you come to
Collegedale.
Best wishes to you and your family for a very pleasant holiday season.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
