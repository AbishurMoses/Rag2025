Dear Brother Higgins:
Chuck del Valle has Just been in my office and submitted
his application for a Publishing Department Career Scholarship.
I am happy to pass this along to you, for we be1 lieve he is
very promising material so far as the publishing work is
concerned. He has successful field experience and even
assisted last year in helping student colporteurs. He has
a very fine personality, and I am sure will make a most
successful field secretary Someday.
I am happy to pass this form along to you according to
the instruction regarding career scholarship applications
which specifies that the Ã©ean of the college is to pass
it along to the treasurer of the publishing house.
It is a pleasure to pass this along to you, for I believe
Chuck del Valle is worthy and fulfilis the specifications
of this plan. I believe that he will rise in the publishing
ranks to fill an important position someday.
With very kindest regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
G. B. Shankel
Academic Dean
