Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Rees:
Thanks so very much for your very prompt reply to my letter
concerning the young people's trip to the Bahamas. We are
looking forward to this cruise very, very much. Wish you all
could come.
We may have no problem at all in the young people getting back.
It is quite possible that we will come in a littte earlier than
we anticipated; however we still face the problem of customs
inspection. I am sure that the young people can be there by
morning.
The names of those involved I gave to Dean Snyder when I called
today, but I thought I would put them in writing here for you.
Those that we are sure of that are from SMC are:
Don Davidson
Joyce Johnson
Betty Davis
Ronald Watson
Hazel Hauck
Kenny Armstrong
We're not sure whether Kenny Armstrong is from SMC. There aren't
too many involved in this, but we hope it will be a forerunner
of a group of college young people that can take part in some
of our activities here in the Florida Conference.
Thanks again for your very kind reply. We wish you a very
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Very sincerely your friend,
amea
G. Ray James, Secretary
