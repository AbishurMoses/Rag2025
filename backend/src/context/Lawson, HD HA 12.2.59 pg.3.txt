Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Brother Shankel:
Recently we have been investigating the possibility of Highland
Academy purchasing goods at the War Sirplus Department in Nashville.
We have not been able to do this for a number of years because of
the fact that we are not accredited with the State of Tennessee.
We are working on this and probably within a year or two will be
able to meet all of the requirements of the state. In the mean-
time we are missing out on some wonderful opportunities to save
money by purchasing goods at War Surplus. We just read the catalog
and we noticed that to be an approved school there must be an
accredited college in the sate or an approved college which
accepts our credits unconditionally. Of course, Southern Missionary
College does this and it is accr√®dited with the Southern Association,
Therefore I am wondering if it would be possible for you to send
to me two copies of a letter stating that SMC does accept the
credits of students graduating from Highland Academy unconditionally.
Anything you might wish to put in the letter would be satisfactory
with us. This, I believe, would mak e it possible for us, along
with the other requirements, to purchase goods at War Surplus.
We would appreciate your doing this at your earliest convenience
as we would like to get our application blanks into the state just
as soon as we possibly can.
Sincerely yours,
ausw
H. D. Lawson, Principal
