Dear Mr. Nilson:
We appreciate the efforts which havebeen put forth to give our
college a beautiful seal. In checking with various members of
the committee, we feel that the round seal would be preferable
and that one should be developed on the order of the copy sub-
mitted. We like your lettering on the black and gold seal but
prefer that Southern Missionary College be written from left to
right across the top of the seal and that the words "Veritas Vincit"
meaning truth conquers, be inscribed inside the center along with
the emblems of the Bible, the sword, the shield, and the helmet.
The date should appear at the bottom. We are not satisfied with
the emblems as they presently appear on the design submitted.
Also the edging that you have on the black and gold seal is much
nicer than the larger edging on our sample. We would very much
appreciate the development of a seal on the order of the copy sub-
mitted with the suggestions.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

P.S. We are sorry that the artist did not have our sample available.
We had hoped that they could be stopped before going too far with the
original designs but it does give us an idea of the art work available.
We like the black and gold idea.
