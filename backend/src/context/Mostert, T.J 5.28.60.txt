Dear Elder Mostert:
I am writing to you at this time with regard to the unfortunate
incidents which resulted in our having to send Sarah Dalton
home. We, of course, were greatiy disappoihted at having to do
this but the situatoon was such that we were left no other
choice. Since the school year is practically completed, the
committee did feel that she should be allowed to write her
examinations and thus not lose credit for her work. We were
agreeable to this plan provided we could find someone from her
home church to supe rvise the giving of these examinations and
it was suggested that you, as the elder of the church, might
be willing to arrange for this. If you are not able to do so
personally, we will have to know that someone of responsibility
would be able to undertake this for us. We are sorry to have
to make a request of this kind, but I am sure you will be willing
to help this gir1 in this way and then forward the examination
papers back to us.
I am, therefore, taking the liberty to send under separate cover
in a day or two a copy of each of the examinations. These may
be taken according to your convenience, but a period of two
hours should be provided for each examination.
I assure you that we appreciate you helping us out in this way.
We are giving her the privilege of writing these examinations
and I hope she wi1l appreciate the opportunity of writing them.
Thanking you for your cocperation in this matter, I am
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Sliankel
Academic Dean
