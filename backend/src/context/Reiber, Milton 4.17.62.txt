Dear Brother Reiber:
Sorry that the youmg man whom you baptized has another three
years in the Air Force before he can pursue his college program
in the field of Theology. We are happy that he is contemplating
college and hope that the three years will not remove this desire.
The college permits a total of twelve semester hours by
correspondence. Correspondence credit on the upper biennium
level may not apply toward the student's major or minor. Of
course since this young man has not gone to college, be would
tale courses on the freshman or sophomore levels. It would
be best if the young man would not take correspondence work in
his major or minor field, especially above the freshman level.
In order to secure credit, even on the lower division level,
the student must earn a grade above a "C" in order to apply
toward a major.
I would suggest that this young man take correspondence work
in American History, or perhaps Buropean Civilization. In order
that he keep up his interest in the field of Bible, it may be
we1l for him to take at least one or two courses in Bible such
as Life and Teachings of Jesus, Pundamentais of Christian Faith
which is Bibie doctrines and perhaps Prophetic Gift which
represents a study of the Spirit of Prophecy. These three
courses would be fundamental and certainly would give him a
good background to the teachings of the Bible.
If we can be of any further assistance, please let. us hear
from you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M, Schneider
AÃ§ademic Dean
