Dear Brother Dick:
Greetings from the Southland. This is my third year at SMC and I
think the last one. I have been serving as Dean this year and have
been urged to continue, but I will be 65 this summer and have decided
to accept sustentation. I still hope to be active in service some-
where, but with the wife gone part of the time assisting in the
work in the Newr York Center where Virginia Gene has charge of the
music while her husband finishes his residency in surgery, it has
been inconvenient for a1l of to say the least.
In connection with my application for sustentation I need to have
a worker who is acquainted with the begimning of my service to
testify as to the time. I thought of you as well able to do so.
You wi1l recail that you weze the one who called me to Canadian
Union College in 1921. That was in Calgary where I spent a year
with F. W. Johnston leading the music for his evangelistic campaign.
I finished Walla Walla in June of 1920 and came directly to Calgary
for the year 1920-21 and then went to Lacombe in 1921 to be with
you for your last year as president before leaving for Africa.
If you can send me a statement verifying the date and place of 4
entering denominational service I will deeply appreciate it.
Our future plans are quite uncertain at the moment. Dr. Rittenhouse
has one more year of chief residency to complete his work. That
will be in Boston. Some of the folk at AUC are anxious for me to
come up there and help out in some capacity but a1l this is uncertain.
Harvey and Virginia Gene are really interested in going out to some
mission field, and if they do we will go with them. We are praying
for guidance in the matter.
With very kind regards, I am
Cordially your brother,
G. E. Shankel
