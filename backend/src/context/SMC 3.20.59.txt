Dear Sir:
There has been an Association of Adventist Podiatrists
formed.
We would like to introduce you to the profession of
Podiatry by having you read one of the pamphlets inclosed.
We would also like for you to place these pamphlets
in the college library for students interested in preparing
for a most interesi ting career, in the youngest of all the
professions of the healing arts, and most adaptable to
Seventh Day Adventist men and women.
For further information please write to the above
address.
Sincerely yours,
Dr. Paul Miller
