Dear Brother Sowers:
We appreciate your interest in Miss Sandra Collier as a
prospective secretarial teacher in your school. We wish
it were possible for us to advise of her availability but
this is not our privilege. Miss Collier wi1l be married
this summer and her husband to be will not be finishing
college util a year hence. This arrangement wi11 make it
necessary for then to live in our community for another year.
During this time I believe Miss Collier plans to work in
Civil Service employment. There is no one: else that we can
suggest to you. The other young lady, Joanne Anderson, is
married and her husband will be working with his father in
Florida following graduation, We are very sorry that we
can be of so little use to you at this time. Should you have
other needs, please let us hear from you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider

Dear Brother Schneider:
A few days ago I would have stated that my faculty for this year
was complete, but I learned today that it would be necessary for
me to obtain a secretarial science teacher.
In Looking over your list of graduates I might be interested in
Miss Sandra Collier, as she has not already been placed, if
she is still available. I would appreciate it if you could send
me complete information as to her scholastic standing and other
information that might be of help.
Thanking you for your information,
I am very sincerely,
