Dear Brother Lawson:
We appreciate your letter of April 2 inquiring about certain of our
graduates.
Barbara Zilke and Barbara Hoar are both English Majors and are not
yet placed. You certainly would be welcome to contact these young
ladies in the women's residence hall by phone or if you should come to
the campus, we would be most happy to set up appointments with them
for you.
Iwould not recommend Mary Ann Deakins. Mary Ann has had some
emotional problems and is presently planning to be married anyway B0
would not be available.
Sylvia Sellers is an excellent musician and is not yet placedaccording to
our records.
I am enclosing the placement folders for each one of these young ladies.
As soon as you are through with them, we would appreciate your returning
them to this affice.
Judy Edwards is a Home Bconomics major but has a minor in Communications
and could teach Speech, Home Economics, and English. Judy just recently
became engaged and 80 I am not sure of her plans. We could highly recom-
mend her, however, and you are certainly free to contact her.
IFI may be of any further service, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
