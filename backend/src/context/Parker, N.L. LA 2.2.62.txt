Lynwood, California
Dear Brother Parker:
Yesterday I learned that you may have an interest in a young
lady by the name of Ruth Lutz who will be graduating from
our school this spring. We understand that you wish her to
teach Biology, Spanish, and perhaps German. Ruth should be
able to do a good Job of all of these, especially the Biology
and Spanish. With a little additional school work in German
she will be able to handle that also.
The roomnat te of Ruth Lutz, Annetta Owens, came in yesterday
afternoon with the request that I write you in regard to any
possibility of her securing employment in your institution as
a teacher of Home Economics. She had heard of a possible
opening in this area on your campus. You will be able to find
her picture ixt our senios placement brochure which has been
mailed to a1l of the academy principais.
Annetta is a very fine young lady with average ability. Annetta
has a slight facial deformity on the left side which has made her
a listle self-cnnscions throegh the years and for that reason has
developed a little introversion. She seems to be doing a good
Job in her student teaching. You may secure full information
regarding her by writing to Mrs. Dorothy Christensen, head of
the Home Ecovomics Department.
Should yos have other needs, we will be pleased to hear from
you and perhaps we wi1l be able to assist you in making up
your staff for next year.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbers M. Schneider
Academic Dean
