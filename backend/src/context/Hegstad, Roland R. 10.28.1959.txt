Dear Brother Hegstad:
How are things in the Religious Liberty Department? I an
Sure that you will give a real lift in that department, and
I am glad to know the plan recently launched to secure
articles. I wish I had the time to make a contribution,
but I doubt with my busy school program that will be possible,
for to really contribute something worth while requires a
considerable amount of study and research.
A few years ago when I was preparing for a sermon here as
religious liberty secretary I searched through the back
copies of Liberty for a suitable poenm. Not finding one,
I composed one although not claiming any poetic power.
I forwarded it to the Religious Liberty Department for
consideration, I wonder if it was ever used. I am enclosing
a copy if you care to check on the matter and can see what
poen I am speaking of.
Liberty is a subject on which there is not too much written
in the nature of poetry, and I thought possibly it might
be utilized sometime if you so desire.
With very kind regards and wishing you every success in your
important work, I am
Very sincerely your s,
G. E. Shanke1
