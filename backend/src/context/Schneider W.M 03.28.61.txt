Mr. P. E. Schlehuber, Principal
Upper Columbia Academy
Spangle, Washing ton
Dear Brother Schlehuber:
Several weeks ago you called in regard to an assistant dean of women
for your school. We were not able to provide you with the necessary
information at the time, but there seems to be some possibility of Mrs. Carmen
wishing anothez job as a dean of women or assistant dean of women.
Mrs. Carmen is presently serving as our dean of women on the Orlando,
Florida, campus in charge of our nursing students. In another year we are
going to try to fi1l this position with someone that is already on the staff
performing some other duties. We feel that this is not a full-time job, and
it is necessary for us to economise in our nursing program.
Mrs. Carmen is a sister, I believe, of Mr. Walter Bunch living at
College Place, Washington. Mr. Bunch operates the associated filling
station there in College Place.
Thought you would be interested in this lead, and perhaps I can give
you still another lead in the name of LaRue Landers, Phil Campbe1l, Alabama.
Miss Landers graduated here last year with a home economics ma. jor. She is
now anxious to enter denominational employment, and I believe she would
accept a job as dean of women with the possibility of teaching some home
economics. You may contact Miss Landers by writing to her at the above
address. She is be: ing considered by the Southwestern Union for several
possibilities, thus I suggest a telephone call if interested. Miss Landers
is highly regarded by the met mbers of our staff on this campus.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
