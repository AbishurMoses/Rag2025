Mr. Wi11 J. Henson
Collegedale
Tennessee
Dear Mr. Henson:
At a meeting of the Academic Policies Committee
your request to substitute two hours of upper-division
to make up for your Bible Survey deficiency was
approved.
Inasmuch as you are a religion major and cotal
hours taken in that field more than satisfy the intent
of the requirement, the committee saw no reason to
have the Survey of Bible course.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
