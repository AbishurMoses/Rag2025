Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Cassell:
We join with the college in gratefulness to citizens of
Chattanooga who have so generously expressed their appreciation of
Southern Missionary College by their recent monetary gift.
We at WSMC-FM feel that the best way Southern Missionary College
could show its appreciation to the Chattanooga community for its support
of our institution would be to provide a high quality radio signal.
Twelve thousand dollars would provide a 5,000 watt Collins trans-
mitter that could later be adapted for stereo broadcasting.
Our prayers accompany this note. We also say thank-you for your
congeniality toward Dr. Kenneth Wright and Ray Shirley who recently
visited us from the University of Tennessee.
Sincerely yours,
ba Rhellype
Ed Phillips
General Manager
