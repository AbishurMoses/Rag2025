Mr. Vernon Schmeider
Shafter, California
Dear Vernon:
Yesterday I received a letter from a Mr. Sydney Allen of Berkley,
California. The letter is self-explanat tory but it does not per-
tain to us. We do not know whether you attended the campmeeting
mentioned in the letter, but it may be that one of the Schneiders
there are involved. If this letter does not pertain to one of you,
I have no further suggestion.
We returned yesterday from a vacation trip to Oklahoma and Colorado.
We had an enjoyable time with our folks in Oklahoma and also spent
a week in the mountains of Colorado. On our return Oklahoma was
very nice and cool and so was our trip home. The country side was
green all the way and it seems that all of the states have had
plenty of moisture. Our coumtry here is beautiful and green.
We are prepared to entertain a host of teachers from our various
colleges. They will have a conference here for the next few days.
Also it will be necessary for us to prepare for the coming school
year.
Perhaps if time lasts,we will be able to see you next year at the
time of the General Conference Session. It seems that the forces
in the world are shaping up fast for the soon return of our Saviour,
but we will have to occupy until the event takes place.
Ardith joins me in sending warn regards to a1l of you there at
Shafter and especially to your mother. We will be pleased to hear
from some of you as you find time to write.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
