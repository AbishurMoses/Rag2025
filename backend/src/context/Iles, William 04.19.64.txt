Dear Bill:
Unfortunately I must have misplaced my reservation slip for the
Committee of 100 luncheon in Orlando on the 23rd. At the present time
I am not too clear about plans concerning my wife but I am planning to
be there myself. Since we have two small children, we have not yet
been able to work out proper arrangements for their care while we
are gone.
I will be in Chicago this coming week and will plan to arrive at McCoy
Air Force Base at 9:41 p.m. on April 22. If at all possible, Iwould
like for someone to meet me at that time. Would it be possible for me
to stay that night either at the Sanitarium or in a nearby imotel or hotel?
I hate to put this burden on you but my plans have been rather indefinite
until rather recently and I have not been able to make proper reservations
for staying over night on the 22nd.
We certainly appreciate your loyal support of the college and your willingness
to make these arrangements for the luncheon on the 23rd.
Best wishest to you.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
