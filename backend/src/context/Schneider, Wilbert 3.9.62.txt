Dear Mr. Schpeider:
In reply to your inquiry of March 1, I am glad to tell
you that the 1962-63 application materials will be sent
you as soon as we are ready to distribute them to par-
ticipating institutions. It was our plan to mail them
early this month, but we have decided that it is advisable
to wait for awhile in the hope that the Congress will act
on our supplemental appropriation and thus permit us to
inform insi titutions of any funds which they may still re-
ceive under Part I-C of the of the 1961-62 request. With-
out such information it would be difficult for our insti-
tutions to make a realistic computation of their needs
for 1962-63.
Sincerely yours,
Kendric N. Marshall
Assistant Chief.
