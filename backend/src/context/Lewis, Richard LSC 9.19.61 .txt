OFFICE OF THE
DEAN

Dr. Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Wilbert:
It was a pleasure to receive another letter from you. There are many
problems which I am beginning to share with you, relating to grade point
averages and the meaning of grades in any particular college. I want to
carry on a series of studies here at La Sierra College and also to report
to the faculty each semester as to the dis tribution of grades assigned by
each teacher and by the school as a whole. No doubt there will be a num-
ber of items which we can correspond about with mutual profit.
Thank you for the good word about "Protes tant Dilemma." I did a good
deal of sweating on that project, and hope that it convinces someone.
I am interested to note that you are designated "Academic Dean" which
seems to me to be a better designation than "Dean of the College" as has
been assigned to me. I suppose they phrase it thus in order to correspond
to "Dean of Students."
We closed registration Friday with 901 enrolled. How many have come in
since, I am not sure, but we ought to have somewhere bet tween 950 and 1,000.
This will be our top registration, I believe. We look forward to bigger
years ahead. As you know, we have an excellent faculty and a tremendous
need for buildings. We hope that in the next few years we will have some
real progress to show to our new and old friends.
Sincerely yours,
Richard B. Lewis
Dean of the College
