Dear Lowell:
Enclosed you will find a list of the names of our feeder schools and
the ACT contact persons in these schools as designated by the school
principal. -
We certainly appreciate Mr. Davidson's and your interest in our
testing project for the southern states area. I am sure Andrews uas
University and we could use the same procedures without any difficulty.
Recently I had a letter from Bill Adams assuring us that he would be
happy to work with us in this program.
Again let me say how much I have appreciated the very cooperative
spirit I have found among all of the representatives of the ACT
program. It is a real pleasure to work with you. IfI can be of any
further service, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
