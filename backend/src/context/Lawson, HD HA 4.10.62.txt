Mr. R. D. Lawson, Principal
Highland Acadeny
Portiand, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Lawson:
While at the Bducation Conference in Carolina, you and Mr.
Stannard of Miani gave me three names of students which the
college accepted without having completed the four years in
one of our academies. 7wo of these names were John Green and
Iarry Meyers. Pirst of all, let me say that both of these
young men seen to be doing excellent work from a scholastic
point of viewr and apparently they have given uS no trouble
socially speaking. Their names have not come to our attention
and I, thei refore, conclude that they have been behaving themselves
in a respectable manner.
In checking their files, I note that John Green, by transferring
his Highland credits to Sandy yhook High School in his home town,
was able to secure a diploma. He has a total of 18 and one eighth
secondary credits and of course this would clear hin definitely
for acceptance by the college. Larry Meyers is doing we1l scho-
lastically, but his transcripts indicate a shortage of credits
which he had intended to secure through the Summes r months. Perhaps
he has done this and we have not secured a transeript from the
Home Study Institute.
We must be careful not to encourage students to apply for college
admission at an early date. In the above named cases we fee1
satisfied that the students were ready for college work from an
academic point of view. We certainly hope that they will adjust
themselves socially also. In the case of Larry Meyers, we have
had the problen of regular worship attendence but this is a matter
of discipline which apparently he did not learn at home. His father
is very ancious that the rule be applied in any event. We appreci-
ate his father's position.
Ife√®ver you are made aware of a mutual problem that should be
called to our attention, we are most anxious that you let us know
immediotely.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi 1bert M. Schneider
