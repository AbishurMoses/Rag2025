Dear Bob:
esaso.w.
nsea oincebsoA
On several occasions prior to my leaving Berrien Springs we mentioned
the possibility of your joining with us here at Southern Missionary
College. I think I told you about the new shopping center with a barber
shop consession. It is a very modern well-equipped little shop with
one chair and with space and a mirror for another chair.
The barber who is presently operating the shop has not been well
accepted by either the student body or the faculty.
Our shopping center is well patronized by students and faculty as well
as many people who are not Adventists. There is grocery store, a
general merchandise store, a Post Office, a Book and Bible House,
Credit Union, an Insurance Agency, a washateria, and a beauty salon.
Consequently, I believe there is a real opportunity here if we could get
the right person.
Mr. Fleming, the business manager, suggested I contact you since I
have mentioned your name to him on several occasions. I believe you
mentioned to me at one time that you might have an interest in coming
to Southern Missionary College. Although we are not as large as
Andrews, we do have an enrollment this year of 870 students in addition
to a large number df faculty and employees in our many industries.
The going price here for hair cuts at the present time is $1.25. I
do not think you would have any difficulty getting all the business you
would want.
The climate is milder here than in Michigan, of course, and the setting
of Southern Missionary College is most beautiful. We are in a little
valley with mountains all around.
