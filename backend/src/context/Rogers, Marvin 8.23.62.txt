New Carlisle, Ohio
Dear Mr. Rogers:
During my absence the registrar prepared the enclosed transcript
and passed on to the head of our Bducation Department the form
which Reeded certification concerning your graduation and status
as a student.
Inasmuch as I have been here only two years, it would be very
difficult for me to certify your character as fit for the teaching
program, I have no doubt as to this but it is not possible for me
to do so.
Since you graduated from this institution approximately ten years
ago, you have perhaps sexved in various places and in several
capacities. Perhaps It would be better for such individuals as
have known you more recentiy to certify as to your character.
The information which has been given me leads me to believe that
you had somewhat of a difficult time while in school. Perhaps
you can explain this problem to my understanding. We certainly
do not hesitate to recommend our young people for teaching
positions but we do want to be careful not to bring reproach on
any individusi or irstitution. If it is absolutely necessary
that the enclosed voucher be signed by us to secure your certi-
fication in the state of Ohio, we would be pleased to have you
give us thersames of some individuals with whon you have more
recently worked. This would give us an opportunity to secure
first hand information. Also it would be necessary for you to
complete the form befoxe sending it back to us for the final
signature.
We certainly sane to assist you in securing certification in
Ohio, but inasmuch as those who do remember you are concerned
about your performance while in school at several institutions,
it would be well for 9S to get more recent character references.
I am sure that you wi11 understand our predicament.
Very sincerely your 8,
Wilbert M. Schneider
