Dear Charles:
I was advised today that a charge came through
from the Dean's office for a dollar and sixty-
five cents having to do with B ome calling cards
C onnected with your invitations, etc., for
graduation.
If you can mail a money, order to me or to the
office of the Dean for $1.65, this will clear
the charge. We prefer to do this than to open
an account in the Accounting Office.
Let me take this opportunity to assure you how
pleased I am to deal with you during the last
two years. I trust that you are enjoying your
work and that heaven's blessings will be with
younoontinually.
Sincerely yours,
Aolat
