Mr. W. Paul Stevens
P.O. Box 1072
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Stevens:
It was nice to receive your letter and to learn that you
are in the teaching profession which can be a missionary
enterprise outside of the denominational organization as well
as within. I as sume that you are continuing your educational
progress in order to be better qualified as a teacher.
In regard to the incomplete in Organic Chemistry for the
first semester for the 1954-1955 year, I think it would be best
to make application to the Academic Standards Committee
thro ough Dr. Schneider for an acceptable procedure to eliminate
the grade of incomplete. The Committee will have to pass on
any arrangement, so it would be best to get a plan of procedure
from the Committee in the first place. You can be assured of
my full cooperation with whatever arrangement can be made.
Sin√ßerely,
helse
