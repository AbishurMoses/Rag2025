Mr. Weber Johnson, Auditor
Pacific Union Conference of
Seventh-Day Adventists
Box 146
Glendale, California
Dear Brother Johnson:
We arrived here in Collegedale July 14 and since then have
settled into the new Job. OF course, we will miss our
association with the members of the Pacific Union Conferenice
gro oups. I do believe that the school work wiil be very satis-
fying even though I did enjoy the treasureship of the Lona
Linda Food Company. Working with minds has always been a great
challenge and we hope to do our best here in this place.
A young man by the nane of Eugene Luttrell is gredueting this
sunmer with a Business ajor. Mr. Luttrell has served in the
Armed Forces which accounts for the delay in finishing college.
He is married and has one child. His wife is a registered
nurse.
Mr. Luttrell is very ansious to secure work within the Seventh-
Day Adventist organization. He appears to be a very fine fellow
and I believe he would fit into a Conference Book and Bible House
setup as assistant or in sone Sanitarium office. Naturally, he
would not wish to begin as head man in any or√ßanization.
Mr. Luttrell seens to be particularly interested in Book and
Bibie House work which would permit hin to go out and speak to
some of the churches fron time to time. He has taken training
in honiletics and has enjoyed speaking to church groups.
Since his graduation comes up in a few weeks he is very anxious
to inow of any placenent possibilities. As you survey the
situation in the Pacific Union, would you kindly let us know
of any openings.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M, Schneider
Acedemic Dean
