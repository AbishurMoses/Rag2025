Dear Harvey:
I was very interested to know that you are now treasurer of
the Alberta Conference. Rest assured that if we ever find
it possible to visit Western Canada, we wi1l surely get in
touch with you. We are indeed sorry that this pleasure was
never burs while we were at Walla Walle College. Maybe some
day I can return to the college of the northvest.
During the last three years at Emmnnuel Missionary College
I was Academic Dean but when the invitation came to go into
treasurers work in Californie, I accepted. For two years I
was treasurer of the Loma Linda Food Company which represented
a very interesting experience, but it was very difficuit to
get away from the challenges of school 1ife. The problems
were not as acute as they are on a college campus but we did
miss the young people and the educational work. Perhaps I
would not have been so bored had 1 not had so many assistants
who did a11 the work.
Aftet deciding to return to education, wE received several
invitations and since we had never worked in the southland,
we decided to accept the academic deanship of Southern
Missionary College. This is a lovely valley and the peopie
here have been very fsiendly. Ours is not the largest school
but we have approximately 750 young people enro 11ed. Our new
ladies residence hal1 was completed last summer and this was
fortunate inasmch as our enrollment increased by about 22
per cent. In a few days we wi1l begin construction on a
mew shopping center. After tbis is completed, it will be
possible for us to clear the front campus and landscape the
area according to plans.
