Southern Miss ionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Schneider:
In keeping with your reques t that I inform you conc erning any
decision about my enrolling as a graduate student of Stetson
University, I will say that after receiving your letter etating
the attitude of Dr. Rees, yourself and Brother Fleming I took
the liberty of discussing it with Brother Welch and Elder Schmidt
before making any further move. They both were in agreemen t
with the plan for me to go ahead and work toward the Master's
Degree at Stetson. So, on the basis of your letter and their
concurrance, I have sent my application to the University and
have requested my college credits from s. M. 0. and my wo rk
at Loma Linda University be S ent to the chairman of the Graduate
Division. I ha ve completed the necessary health requirements
and should my application be accepted, I plan to begin work
the second 8 emester.
As it appears now I should have all the requirements out of
the way by the end of th e summer school session of 1964 which
is about a year and a half from now. They have been mos t
cordial and cooperative in waiving attendance at graduating
exercises if they should C ome on Friday night or any other
complications that might be based upon religious Convictions.
Perhaps the board will have met and any action in this matter
be official by thetime I come up to the college in January.
Maybe we could spend a few minutes discussing the program if
that is necessary at that time.
Thanking you. for your interest and your cooperation in getting
the way cleared to begin, I am,
Very sincerely yours,
-
