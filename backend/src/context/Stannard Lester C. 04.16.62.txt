Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Schneider:
I have appreciated reading your recent letter concerning
Dorothy Walden and other students being accepted at S.M.C.
before having spent 4 years in the academy.
Certainly I want you to know that I fully understand the
viewpaint of the college. When I mentioned it being a
great mistake I should have clarified it by saying that
the impression left with parents and students is that
S.M,C, will take students after only 3 years in the academy.
These folks, of course, are looking at finances and not at
education as a whole when they do this. We believe that
even good students need the rounding out that 4 years can
give. Then, too, there is the pressure that is put on the
college for acceptance of these young people of which wea
are very much aware.
I want you to know that we always want to work with you
folk and I look forward to an even closer association
when I enter fully into my work in the Carolina Conference.
Sincerely,
Lester C. Stannard
