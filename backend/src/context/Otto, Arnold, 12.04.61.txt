Mr. Arnold Otto
Collegedal ie, Tennessee
Dear Brother Otto:
The worth of a teacher is always difficult to measure but
even through the eyes of a mortal individual, va lues can be
seen and understood. After learning of the finale of the
discipline episode in which you were involved, there was no
doubt in my mind but that you taught the greatest lesson in
one day of the entire year.. The young people understood the
language involved and I am sure that they will never forget
the most fundamental lesson of life.
We sincerely appreciate your interest in the young people
of the elementary school.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
