Dear Mr. Strickland:
I wish to thank you for your letter of February 9.
I appreciate this invitation to share in the work
of the League. However, I may say that I do not
expect to be in this area after the present tern;
and since this is a very busy season of the year
for the Dean of the College, I think it would be
best for me not to undertake any assignments at this
time.
Certainly this is a most noble work, and I should
enjoy it very much if I were going to remain here
for some time. Under the circumstances, however,
I feel that I should not undertake any additional
responsibility. I appreciate this confidence very
much and wish you every success in the fine work
being carried forward.
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean

Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Shankel:
The cause of Christian sobriety is being actively promoted in Tennessee
by United Tennessee League, Inc. Speakers representing this organization
address assemblies and classes in educational institutions all over the
state.
A major phase of our work is done from the pulpits of most of the evangeli-
cal denominations. To meet the increasing need for church speakers we
have a list of more than forty Adventist workers and numerous other
ministers who fill appointments when they have available time. This list
embraces some Collegedale men incl uding Doctors Bushnell and Christensen,
Elders Beckner and Hendershot, and Brethren Gordon Hyde and J. M. Ackerman
who now speak for the League as need arises.
We know you are interested in this great cause. The League would like
to enroll your name on our list of part-time speakers. Would you be willing
to speak for the League on certain Sundays in churches of various denomina-
tions? This would be largely a labor of love. The honorarium is small,
ten dollars for speaking at eleven o'clock, an additional three dollars
if the speaker also talks at a Sunday school hour, and another five dollars
if there is a night meeting.
Expenses are paid at three cents a mile for operating your car and the
League pays for your meals while on each mission.
We hope you will consent to devote some of your time and talent to this
important missionary enterprise. Please let us hear from you soon.
Cordially,
R.B1 Sticbland
