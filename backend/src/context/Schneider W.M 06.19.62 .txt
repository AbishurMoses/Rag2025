Dear Mr. Stewart:
Sorry we are unable to give you a fr√©shman orientation program
booklet as conceived on this campus. We, too, are thinking of
revising our program somewhat by. cutting short the time spent
in orientation at the beginning of the year and giving nore at
a later time. We find that the freshman student is unable to
absorb too many facts during the first week of his stay on this
campus.
After you have your's worked out, we will be very happy to
receive a copy of it.
I have just located extra copies of last fall and also the
fa1l of 1960. These are enclosed. For the lectures in both
instances, you will note a basic theme of thought. We feel
that perhaps it would be best not to run the freshmen students
through a multiple testing program the first few days of his
arrival on the campus. Some of the test pertaining to personality,
etc. could be administered at a later time. As soon as I have
completed the class schedule, we shall plan our fall orientation
program with the faculty and also the students.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi 1bert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
