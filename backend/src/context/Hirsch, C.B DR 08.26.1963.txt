Doctor C. B. Hirsch, President
Columbia Union College
Takoma Park 12, Maryland
Dear Doctor Hirsch:
In talking with you at the meeting in Lincoln, I mentioned our need
for a Ph.D. in Business Administration or Business Economics here
next year.
I believe you mentioned a Mr. Bob Robinson and a Mr. Rolfe. I
have tried to contact these individuals at the University of Maryland
and have not been successful. Consequently I wonder if you could
give me any further information relative to their present home
address.
I appreciate your sharing these names with me. We are going to try
to get through the year with the personnel we now have but we will not
be able to continue this another year.
Itrust things are going well at Columbia Union College and that you
are anticipating another good enrollment.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
