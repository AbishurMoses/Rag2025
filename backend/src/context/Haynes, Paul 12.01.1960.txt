Dear Brother Hay ynes :
Should we learn of anyone going west January 1 or
January 10, we shall be pleased to give him the information
in regard to your request to have an automobile driven out
for you.
Inasmuch as that does not coincide with the close of our
semester or the Christmas holiday season, it may be rather
difficult to find someone to drive your autonobile out.
In any event, we shall keep this request in mind.
Very sincerely yours,
