Mr. Harold Lee
Senior Class President
Oakwood College
Huntsville, Alabama
Dear Mr. Lee:
The Collegedale Academy senior class does not participate
with the college class in the week end commencement
exercises. Generally speaking, the academy graduates its
seniors either a week prior or a week following the week end
services for the college.
At the junior college in Texas while I was on the staff there,
the two classes participated in the same services, but I
believe that-they have modified this somewhat.
It is our preference that the academy schedule its graduation
services perhaps a week earlier. The college, of course,
schedules the regular consecration service for Friday night,
the baccalaureate service at the eleven o'clock hour on
Sabbath and the commencement service at ten o'clock on
Sunday morning.
We have been pleased to provide this information and should
you have any other questions, please let us hear from you
again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
