Dear Dr. Rees :
We are looking for someone at the Lynwood Academy who would
fill the position of Food Director for our school. This would
not have to be an individual with a degree in Foods although,
that might be valuable. We are actually looking for some lady
who could come in and in a practical way fill the responsibility
of directing the dining room service and oversee the cooking of
the food for our student body.
We would plan to continue service on the cafeteria style however,
we are open to suggestions for the type of service whether it be
a full meal or some type a la carte plan. If you do have any
suggestions we would be happy to hear from you and we would
follow through on your suggestions.
Thanking you for an early reply, I am
VÃªry sincer ely your s,
pe
