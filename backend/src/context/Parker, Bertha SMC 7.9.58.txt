Dear Friend:
We have spent much time in planning the revision of our
Student Handbook. Before completing it we feel we need to
consider what other S are suggest ing relative tothis area
of the student curriculum. We would appreciate receiving a
Student Handbook from your school at your earliest convenience.
If, for any reason, you do not have a Handbook we would
appreciate a letter stating your policy relative to the dress
regulations. We are particularly concerned with the tendency
to wear extremely low necks, tight fitting garment S and sleeve-
less dresses, shorts, "Short" shorts, capri pants, etc. Do
you allow the wear ing of these and, if so, at what times?
It is the most earnest desire of our faculty to follow the
instruction that God has given "Whatsoever ye do, do all to the
glory of God," and also the counsel to be modest and ever manifest
true refinement.
We do thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Sincerely,
Bthaglkw
Bertha F. Parker, R.N.
Assistant Director, School of Nursing
