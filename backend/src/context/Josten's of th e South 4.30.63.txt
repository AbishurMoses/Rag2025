JOSTEN'S of the South
Shelbyville, Tennessee
Gentlemen:
Under separate cover I am returning one of the Appreclation
Gifts which was slightly damaged. I talked with Mr. Jack Nilson,
your former representative here in this area, this morning on the
phone and he suggested that I drop you a note and ask you to mail
me another one of the Appreciation Gifts. I would appreclate
receiving this as soon as possible as our senior students will soon
be leaving us.
Thank you very much for the fine service which we have received
from Josten's this year and we look forward to your service in the
future.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
