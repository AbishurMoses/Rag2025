Dear Brother Nelson:
It was a pleasure to hear from you again and to know of your
interest in Mr. John Jansen as a ministerial intern in your conference.
John will be completing his program at the end of July, 1963. I
presume that he will be married shortly after that date to Miss
Stephanie Humphries. Miss Humphries has been on our campus two
years and will be finishing a two-year secretarial science program.
She has been employed in our Public Relations office and seems to do
a good job.
John has had his social problems in the past and has not always been
too discreet. He has always had & diiving ambition to go into the
ministry but because of a lack of contrition and perhaps a little of the
Peter in him, it was not easy to counsel him. Schools rules, even
though established for his protection, were not always heeded and
this impulsiveness got him into trouble. I must say, however, that
since his absence from the college the second semester of last year
he has had time to think of his relationship to his God and to his fellow
men. We permitted him to come back to this campus this year and he
has done very well. He has been very cooperative in all matters and
seems to have a genuine zeal to enter the ministry. I am not assuming
that he is out of the woods yet but if he would direct his abilities to the
ministry with a converted heart, he could certainly be an asset to us.
Perhaps you may know his father who is currently serving the Kentucky-
Tennessee Conference as assistant treasurer.
I am not in a position to judge the girl that he is to marry. She is a
very nice looking lady but has not always been too winsome from the
