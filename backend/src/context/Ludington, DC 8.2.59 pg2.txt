Our dear Friends,
We planned to drive over to La Sierra today
to see you 3 but thought that we had better call first
to see if you were still there. We found that the
meeting was over a few days ago sO am writing just
a shont note to say that we enjoyed our trip to Dunlap
and Collegedale very mich.
I enjoy driving after
I get started but dread looking forward to a long
trip when. I have to do all the driving. We had a very
pleasant time and enjoyed seeing so many old friends.
I hope that you will enjoy the new road
around the the house. We stayed there a few days
waiting for the men to do the work, but they seemed to
have other jobs that seemed to be more pressing, in-
cluding the work at the bakery. They did do our job
however before that was completed.
I think it is
quite an improvement. We did several little jobs
around the place while we were waiting for the road
to be completed.
My wife made a few telephone calls, one or two
long distance, which you may charge to us. We also did
a little cooking which might be charged against us also.
My wife says the telephone calls were to Norcross, Georgia,
One was 77 cents and the other 83 cents.
I did a little painting 3 had the eves cleaned,
and the electric company was to make a charge for the
expert they sent out to check all the heaters. The
man from the College came out and did what the expert
suggested, Some of the heating units were replaced.
Perhaps you had better charge all of the electris
bill for June to us. The man from the college made
a separate charge which will be charged tb us.
We hope that you had a fine trip and that man y
plans were made during the conference that will help our
schools as well as the young people.

"ishing you God's blessing as you begin the
neyear, I remain,
Your sincere friend and bpother,
