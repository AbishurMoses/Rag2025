Mr. Vernon Siver, Business Manager
Atlantic Union College
South Lancaster, Massachusetts
Dear Brother Siver:
I an writing to you at this time in the hope that you may have some
suggestion as to a prospective teacher of business and economics for
Southern Missionary College. We thought that Rupert Craig was coming,
ouE having put more than $3,000 into his doctoral work ost in southern
Califormia. But it is the old story again of California being too
attractive. I know Mrs. Craig 1ikes southern Callfornia very mch;
and I would have beezt surprised if we had gotten them aray from there
even though we have put money into then continuously ever since they
left, which should have influenced them some.
This leaves us back where we started from--looking for a head for our
department. We do have tio good men in the department notr but are
looking for someone with a doctorate.
I know that Doctor Stokes had sone very good students at AUC, and it
occurred to me that some of these might have gone on and are now
working torard their doctorate. Since Doctor Stokes is not there
at present, I thought of you as the one that perhaps might know of
Some of the brighter ones that are in graduate work at the present
time.
Our accrediting association here is pretty particular about having
a man with a doctorate at the head of all our divisions, so we are
ansious if possible to find someone that is at least within a short
distance of his doctorate.
Thanking you for such information as you may be able to give me, I
an
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
