Dear Ron:
In order to secure the services of Bider Don Hunter as
speaker for the Culture Week, it was necessary to move
the week with the terminai date of February 18 at which
time I presume the Student Association wishes to schedule
the banquet. You recall that Judy Edwards was elected
social vice president and it has been rather difficult for
her to work out the culture week plans on the spur of the
moment. e
In checking the calendar I note that Mr. Popham of the
Chattanooga Times was to lecture on our campus the evening
of February 18. If Judy intends to schedule the banquet that
night, it would seen that an adjustment wbuld have to be made.
Would you please confer with Judy Edwards regarding this prob-
lem and if Judy is thinking about a banquet that night, perhaps
the two of you ought to work out the situation to satisfy all
concerned.
In checking the calendar, it would be possible to have Mr.
Popham to come to this campus the evening of February 25 which
is a week: later. In order that we may settle this matter at
an early date, would you kindly see Judy immediately. After
you will Dave had the opportunity of checking with Judy about
the problem, would you please see me in order that we may
correspond with Mr. Popham. I believe Mr. Popham could come
the evening of February 25. It is unfortumate, of course, that
we have to change the dates as announced in our brochure.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi lbert M, Schneider
Academic Dean
