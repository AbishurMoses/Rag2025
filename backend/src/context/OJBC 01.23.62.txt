Dear Mr. Iles:
On December 8 you wrote again of your desire to assist a
worthy student in the amount of $250 in order that that
student might remain in school this year. We so much
appreciate your understanding of the problems of many of
our students. The fact that we have not corresponded prior
to this does not indicate a lack of appreciation. By waiting
we are better able to determine what students wi1l be in need
the second semester.
We would like to suggest the names of two students for this
scholarship award, namely, Mr. Bd Motschiedler and Miss
Marilee Baster, each getting $125. We believe that with this
assistance and some Government Loan funds these worthy young
people wi1l be able to finish school this year. Ed Motschiedler
is a theology student and Marilee Easter wi1l be finishing with
a major in English.
If the above suggestions meet with your approval, we sha1l be
happy to extend to them these scholarship funds.
With kindest regards and best wishes for a good year.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

Attention: Mr. Wilbert M. Schneider
Dear Mr. Schneider:
Thank you very much for your letter of November 29 and I am pleased that
you again will accept fr om me the scholarship which was set up last year.
While I leave the matter of the selection and award of the scholarship entirely
to the discretion of the school, you may recall that the original understanding
W as that the scholarship would be for a specific student and not just placed
into a general scholarship fund. Also, it wa as understood that it was not to
bail someone out of an unpaid bill, but rather to take care of the need of some
stud ent who, in prospect, viewed a financial problem and requested the schol-
arship for his need.
I thought the matter was handled very well last year and I stand r eady to make
the s ame arrangement this year for a similar need.
Very truly yours,
Oliver Joe Bailey Co.
