Dear Mr. Harris:
I was very happy to receive your letter of February 10 in which you
inquire about the possibility of a mid-year graduate who might be
interested in comecting with your company. lt sounde as though this
would be a very interesting type of work that would attract some of
our SMC graduates.
Unfortunately we do not have any business administration majors
graduating at mid-term. I know of anly two students who completed
their work at the mid-term and both are already employede -one in
chemistry and the other in a temporary job awaiting her entrance into
medical school.
I am enclosing, however, a copy of our current placement brochure in
the event you see some seniors in this booklet who might quallfy as a
representative for your company, please feel free to get in touch with us.
We will be most happy to arrange personal interviews with them for you.
If we can be of further assistance, please feel free to contact us.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
