Mr. Billy G. Mills
1210 B Independence Avenue
Kansas City, Missouri
Dear Mr. Mills:
I have your letter addressed to President Rees regarding
the matter of graduation from Southern Missionary College
after completing a year of your Osteopathy.
A number of years ago our colleges did follow the policy of
granting degrees after students had complet ted a year of the
medical course. But 50 far as I knowe they have discontinued
this practice for Some time. It would of course be very fine
if you could be an alumnus of this college, but we feel that
we ought to stay in line with what all our colleges are
doing now since we do have a definite regulation in all our
colleges that a student must take the last 24 hours in
residence at that school. A11 our colleges have adopted
this regulation and have discentinued the practice of
granting degrees to students completing a1l or part of the
medical course elsewhere. I regret that we are unable to
do anything about the matter.
I presented it to the committee yesterday, but we feel that
we must stay by our policy. A number of cases of the same
nature have come up recently and in every case we have had
to take the same action which is quite in line with the
policy of a1l our colleges.
Wishing you every success in your work and with very kind
regards, I am
Yours sincerely,
G. E. Shankel

Academic Dean
