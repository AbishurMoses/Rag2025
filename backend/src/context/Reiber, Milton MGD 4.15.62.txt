Collegedale, Tenn.
Dear Dr. Schneider:
I recently baptized a young man in the Air Force who is
stationed near Macon. He has finished his high school
work, and would like to take the theological course. He
still has three years in the Air Force, so I am wondering
if he can take some courses by correspondence. Would you
please tell me how many college hours he would be allowed
by correspondence and what subjects you would recommend
he take that way. Of course, the more he takes now, the
sooner he would get through the course once he is out of
the service. He is 18 years old now.
I would appreciate this information. Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
2Kaileu
Milton T. Reiber
