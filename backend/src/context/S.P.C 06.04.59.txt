Dear Brother Shankel,
We are plannimg a book here at the Sentinel, to be composed
of the mission and evangelistic experi ences that have come to our workers
in Southern Africa. Would you please contribute to this project whatever
striking experiences you may have had?
We need short accounts. They could be between 400 and
1,500 words in length, but the closer they are to 400 words, the better.
We need vivid accounts. The first test they must pass
is the 91 uestion: how interesting is this? If the articles are interesting
and re eadable, they will be read by tl he public and will do much good. They
should be written not only for the reader in Southern Africa, but also with
the overseas reader in mind. Short sentences, simple, well-chosen words,
and graphic presentation, will make for effectiveness. Choose a title,
and put your name down as the writer. If it is a personal experience, use
the first person in relating the story, otherwise use the third person.
Such a book could be used by God to bring encouragement
and vision to many. The Lord may want your testimony to His power in this
bopk. We would be very glad and grateful to receive your contribution
at your earliest possible opportuni ty.
God's blessing remain with you.
Yours in the Master's work,
AcRlu
