Dear Friends:
It was nice to see you again this summer and to leasa of your
interest in coming to the southland. Under separate cover we
are sending an acadeny bulletin and also a college bulletin.
School is well on its way with a good spirit prevailing on our
campus. The hills are still green with just a little color
starting in some of the maple trees. It is a beautiful area
to see this time of the year.
We haven"t had a chance to drive up beyond Nashville to see
Ardith's ucle, Noble Chace. We understand that he has purchased
several hundred acres of land with a doim payment of aroud
$5,000. His son, Marshall, told us he had approximately one
hundred heed of cattle on the pasture land as of now. We hope
we wi1l have the privilege of going up for a weekend before too
long. His brother, Art,,is supposed to have purchased some land
there also but has not moved from the Dakotas yet.
There isn't much of farm land around this area, but some have
daitiesaus stock. The soil is difficult to cultivate because
of its clay and rock content. It is, however, very beautiful.
It would be nice if you could take a journey dov this way to
look over the situation before deciding nn moving. We have
enjoyed living here as much as any place we have lived.
Three of our children are now in school and Ardith is home with
the youngest. Douglas is in his first year of academy work and
Shirley will be finishing the eighth grade this year. Christine
is starting the first.
Let us hear from you as you find time to wzite. Should you sce
any of the children, please give them our regards.
Cordially your friends,
Wilbert M. Schneider
