Dear Campus Representative:
Thank you for your help in choosing this year's Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship candidates from Region VII. The interviews are over now, and
those nominees pass ed by the Regional Committee have been notified. They
have been told. to expect a letter about the middle of March as to whether
or not they have received a Fellowship.
Students invited for interviews but whose papers were not sent to
the National Committee, have also been informed. All of these people re-
ceived Honorable Mention and a list of their names will be mailed to deans
of graduate schools throughout the country after the March announcement.
I have mailed to the deans of graduate schools in our area, the names of
active candidates who did not get beyond the regional level; we hope these
students will be encouraged to pursue their plans for graduate study and
teaching careers. .
This is the breakdown for this year's nominees from Region VII:
Nominated
495
Active
369
Interviewed
143
Recommended

Below is a list of the candidates from your college who are still
being considered for Fellowships. We wish them success and want to thank
you again for your help in bringing them to this stage of the competition.
Sinoerely yours,
& k
