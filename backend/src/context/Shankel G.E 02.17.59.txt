Dear Sir:
On January 3, 1959, I wrote to Dean Ray A. Underhill, asking for
the names of the Librarian and five representative members of the fac-
ulty, to whom I might write about my study of FACUETY-LIBRARIAN RELA-
TIONSHIPS IN LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES.
My only reply has been a questionnaire from G. E. Shankel. I am
grateful for this return, and will find it of much help.
But I would like to have like answers from another four member S of
the faculty; and the librarian.
May I have the names of these five persons, please? Another copy
of my original letter is enclosed, for information.
Trusting that you can do me this kindness, I am
Very truly yours,
wwy
Henry $cherer,
Assistant Librarian.
Over half the deans in the country have sent me lists, with only the
first letter gone out, and no follow-up as yet! I am thrilled!
