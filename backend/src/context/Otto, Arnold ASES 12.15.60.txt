Mr. Arnold Otto
Arthur Spalding Elementary School
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Otto:
In order to be fair with all requests to cash in on the
policy of permitting purchasing of books and tools for self-
improvement, we have deferred your xequest until we can
secure a well-defined policy from the Union Conference
office. Some think of it as a policy to permit the purchase
of tools for self-improvement; others think of it as a
policy permitting the purchase of tools necessary for
one's professional pursuit.
Inasmich as there has been no clearly defined
definition, we sha1l secure the over-a1l Union policy and
come to some decision in regard to your tape recorder
following the holiday season.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi lbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
