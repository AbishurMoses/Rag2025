Mrs. Virginia Nelson
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mrs. Nelson:
You probably wonder why you have not heard from me sooner
regarding your request for certain Home Nursing class needs.
I wanted to check first to see which of these would be needed in
the new Associate Degree Nursing Program. The ather
The other day Mrs. Watson was on the campus and checked your
list. She tells me that most of the things you need have been
donated to us by Mr. Morris, administrator of Madison Hespital.
In addition, however, we will need one plastic baby tub bath used
for foot baths, soaks, bathing baby, etc., a rack for the fomentation
tub, two compress holder wringers, and one and a half yards of
sturdy material for making compress holders. These items you
should go ahead and requisition through Doctor Dean's department.
In his absenceg, belleve it would be acceptable for me to sign for
them.
You should also talk to Mr. Costerisan about moving a stove into
that room in the Home Economics Department that we are setting
up for the use of the Nursing Division. All the other things you
requested will be provided and you may feel free to use them as
needed.
If you should have any further question, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cagsell, Jr.
Academic Dean
