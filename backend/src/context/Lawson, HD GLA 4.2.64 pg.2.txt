Dear Brother Castle:
In checking through your book of graduates I find the
names of 4 individuals we might be interested in. Since they are
in the field of English and Music and these are in short supply I
realize that they may have already been placed. If any of these
have not been placed I would appreciate it if you could send me a
folder giving information about them. In the field of English they
are Mary Ann Deakins, Barbara Zilke, and Barbara Hoar. In the
field of Music the name is Sylvia Sellers. If all of them have been
placed I would appreciate knowing this also. We have openings for
a full time English teacher and some combinations in English, Home
Economics and Organ teaching. If you know of anyother individuals
who might be able to fill these positions we would be more than
happy to have their names. We will be hring at least 2 people to
fill these positions for next year.
Sincerely yours, 9
