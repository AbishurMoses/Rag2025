Berrien Springs, Michigan
Dear Doctor Ritland:
I want to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you
for participating in our lecture series. Your contribution to the
program was greatly appreciated by both students and faculty at
Southern Missionary College. Personally, I believe this has been
one af the most profitable and successful series in my experience.
The topic was most timely and pertinent to a group of young men
and women in a Christian college.
Iam enclosing a complete set df the lectures for your files. I am
firmly convinced that a lectue series can make a very valuable
contribution to the intellectual life of a campus. I am hoping, however,
that next year it will be possible for each participant to spend a day
or two on campus meeting with students in informal discussion groups.
Iwould appreciate any comments that you may have as a result of your
experience which would extend the influence and value of the program.
Best wishes to you as you contime to serve the cause of God.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
