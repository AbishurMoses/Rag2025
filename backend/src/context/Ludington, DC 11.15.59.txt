Dear Brother Ludington;
Brother King, who is now our school accountant, came to
my office a littie while ago concerning the job that was
done on the spray on the sink. I thought it might be
best for me to write to you to explain why it was
necessary to do this job, or at least to do Some thing.
The difficulty lay in the fact that the spray came on
every time someone turned the tap. which of course was
inconvenient on occasion especially if the water was
hot and one did not notice which direction it was pointed.
Nhat I asked was to have the spray disconnected and
plugged for we never used it, but instead they put on
a new spray, which of course solves the problem as far
as we are concerned, but it was an unnecessary expense.
But to have it disconnected and have it plugged would
mean an additional labor charge. Since it has already
been replaced, I imagine you would rather have it left
that way since to change it would mean additional
expense. Since it is part of the permanent plumbing
of the house, I felt that it should be placed on your
statement.
It is certainly a pleasure to have the blacktop road
in and to not have to spin the wheels getting out of
the driveway onto the road now. That is really fine.
We appreciate it a lot.
Everything seems to be in order in the house except that
whoever repla√ßed the element or whatever it is in the
bathroom heater must have replaced it with a very sma 11
element because even when it is turned on high and left
on for half an hour it is barely warn and would never
heat the bathroom except that I take a portable heater
in. It used to heat the bathroom satisfactorioy, but
these cold days it would never heat bbe bathroom alone,
