Mr. Herman C. Ray
1360 Pelham Road
Winter Park, Florida
Dear Brother Ray:
We were pleased to have had the privilege of visiting with
you while on our return trip from Miami. Since then I have
had the chance to read your letter in detail concerning your
desire to proceed with graduate work leading to the master's
degree.
In counsel with Mr. Fleming and Doctor Rees, we have agreed
on a program whereby the school would defray the tuition
expense on the three hours that you, would be taking the second
semester of this year. We would not be able to care for both
your tuition and driving expense inasmuch as this is contrary
to our policy. It may be that Mr. Welch at the sanitarium
would be willing to take care of some of your driving expense.
Perhaps the best arrangement would be for you to pay for the
tuition and send us a notice of the same for our records. We
would be able to credit your account with the tuition expense.
Before we commit ourselves on a summe: r leave in your behalf,
it will be necessary for us to clear the matter with the Board
of Trustees in session at the annual meeting. I am placing your
letter in the Board folder and shall bring the matter to their
attention at that time. Since Elder Schmidt and Mr. Welch are
both on the Board, it will be possible for us to give consideration
to the over all program proposed in your letter. We hope that
this arrangement will be satisfactory. Prior to the annual
Board Meeting, we would be pleased to hear from you again as
to the arrangements you have made for the second sem ester
work of three hours at the Stetson University.
Very sincerely yours,
gl
M. Schneider
