Gentlemen:
We are looking forward to a revision of our college catalog and
are interested. in working up a curriculum leading to social work.
This, of course, is a liberal arts college and we do not wish to
proliferate the degrees offered, but it is entirely possible for us
to present an undergraduate program designed to best fit the needs
of a young lady desiring to go into social work.
Would you kindly give us whatever information you have pertaining
to a good undergraduate program which would qualify young people
for such a profession. We will be very grateful to you for this
service.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M, Schneider
Academic Dean
