Mrs. A. M. Raines
Route I, Box 232
Vicksburg, Mississippi
Dear Mrs. Raines:
We are so sorry to learn of your husband's heart attack. Fortunately
this was not fatal and we sincerely hope thag he will make rapid progress.
We axe pleased to cooperate in permitting your daughter, Denise, the
privilege of remaining home for the remainder of the rest of the week
in order that she may be there during the critical period of your
husband's recovery. I assume Denise is the same young lady that
we have listed as Mary Hennessy. If this is the case, we want to
encourage your daughter to apply herself to her studies while at home.
During the first nine week period Denise did not show zp too well in
her scholastic achievements but I believe she can recover and come
through in good shape for the semester if she diligenely applies herself
to the studies.
Thank you for writing and may I suggest that Denise stop by this office
the day she returns in order that we may inform the teachexs properly.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schmeider
Academic Dean
