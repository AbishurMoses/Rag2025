CHARLES F. KETTERING MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
OFFICE OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
1105 THIRD NATIONAL BUILDING
DAYTON 2, OHIO
April 7, 1961
Mr. Wilbert M. Schneider
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Schneider:
Thank you for your letter of the 2nd. The creation of the Kettering
Memorial Hospital is a tr emendous task and it is vastly complicated.
We hope when it is completed it will be a creditable structure and that
we will be able to develop an organization that will suitably repres ent
the two great names attached to it--Kettering and Seventh-day Adventist.
I have met Kenneth Kissinger's mother and father. I feel certain
that if our hospital were completed at this time and ready to put into
operation that we would have a place for him; but it will be about two
and one-half years before we are ready to open the institution. The
planning period is drawing to a close and construction should get
under way in July.
We have a small staff in the Office of Planning and Development
and do not expect to employ additional personnel until shortly before
the time of opening the hospital. If Mr. Kissinger is interested in
joining our staff at that time, it will be a pleasure to give consider-
ation to his name.
Very sincerely yours,
C - lan
G. B. Nelson
Administrator
