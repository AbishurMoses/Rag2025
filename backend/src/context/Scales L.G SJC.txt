Dear Brother Scales:
A letter dated July 26 requesting information regarding
Mr. James Lynn was referred to me for attention.
I am not personally acquainted with Mr. Lynn, inesmuch
as Ihave recently joined the staff here as academic
dean. His record in the Registrar's Office indicates
that he was not too strong in the field of Chemistry-
His over-a11 grade point average is approximately 1.35.
In the field of Chemistry, his grades were C and perhaps
in one instance a little lower.
I have talled to the Chairman of the Division of Sciences,
Dr. John Christensen, and he does not recomend hin for
college chemistry teaching. He does fee1 that he might
be able to do a fair job on the secondary level. His
character references seem to be above reproach. Perhaps
his service since he left here would indicate his possi-
bilities better than his scholastic record here at school.
We do want to be frank with you and give you the picture
as we have it here in the Registrar's Office.
If we can be of any further help to you, please Iet us
hear from you.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
