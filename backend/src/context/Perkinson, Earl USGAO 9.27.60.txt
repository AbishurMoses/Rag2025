Dear Mr. Perkinson:
We were pleased to receive your letter of September 20
requesting information regarding our accounting graduat tes. We
do offer an accounting major, and we would be pleased to have
you visit our campus for recruitment purposes.
Mr. Raiph Davidson, who is a Certified Public Accountant,
teaches our advanced accounting courses. At present, he is
conducting an evening class in C.P.A, Review Problems. Perhaps
you would like to meet him also.
We have had some very fine young men graduate from our
school with majors in business administration or in accounting.
In some instances, they were able to pass their state G.P.A.
examinations following their college program.
Even though I an the acadenic dean of this college, because
of ay graduate program in the field of business and economics,
I am very much interested in the department of business administra-
tion. One of our departmental members is away on study this year
working toward his Ph.D. degree. I am doing sone teaching this
year and would very much enjoy visiting with you in regard to
your proposed program.
Very sincerély yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
