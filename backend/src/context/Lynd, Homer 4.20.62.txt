Madison, Tennessee
Dear Doctor Lynd:
Inasmuch as you are present 1y making application for National
Defense Education Act Loan Funds, we are pleased to confirm
our practice in accepting credits earned by students at
Madison College subject to the performance of the individual
student.
Credits transferred from Madison College, although recorded
on a provisional basis at the time of the student's admission,
are validated and permanently recorded when the student has
demonstrated his ability to do satisfactory work in resident
at Southern Missionary College. Each year we have had thé A
privilége of accepting students from Madison College. There
is no thought of discontinuing this practice.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
