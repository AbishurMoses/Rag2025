Bmmaaruel Mislionary College
Berrien Springs, Michigan
Dear Willard:
In making contact with the Pacific Press Publishing Association in your
beha 1f, I have learned that there is an opening in the type room, but as of
now, they hardly have anything to interest a man of your caliber. It is
true, of course, that an individual soon finds his own level after accepting
something of this nature, and I am sure you woul ld do just that.
Should you be at a1l interested in such a proposition from the Pacific
Press, you may wish to contact Paul Biseman, who is the superintendent of
the organization.
Still wish you could be with us in this area, and, of course, if your
plans mai terialize, it may still be possible for us to see you sometiue down
in Plorida. I have not contacted the Southe En Publishing Association at
Nashville, and it may be best that I not do so unless I hear otherwise from
you.
The weather today is dismal with ice covering every bough of every
tree. Generally speaking, however, I am sure that we have had it considerably
warmer than you have experienced there at Berrien. If we did not have the
ice today, we would be anxious to send you warm greetings from the Southland,
but we shall have to wait until some other time when the weather will pe: rmit.
Very sincereiy yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
