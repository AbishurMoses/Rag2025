Mr. Samuel Logan
Oakwood College
Peterson Hall
Huntsville, Alabama
Dear Mr. Logan:
We appreciate your interest in our mursing program. We have
tried to build a good program and we hope that further improvements
will be made as time continues.
We regret that as of now it is not possible for us to favorably process
an application from you but we would surely recommend that if you
have a strong interest in nursing that you apply for admission to
Union College or perhaps Columbia Union College. Both of these
schools are operating collegiate schools of nursing. In your letter
you indicated that you weze presently taking the pre-nursing program
at Oakwood. It may be that you aze not interested in the collegiate
program and if that is the case, you may wish to think of the Hinsdale
Sanitarium and Hospital or perhaps Glendale, Both of these schools
provide programs leading to the R.N. which requixes less time than
the collegiate program.
As you note, we axe sending a copy of this letter to Elder Banfield
who will perhaps write you further in regard to the problem which
we face.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbext M. Schneider
Academic Dean
ce: Elder W. S. Banfield
