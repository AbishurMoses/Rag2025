Dear Doctor Kennedy:
While I was a student at Southsrn Miesionary College I was unable to work
practice teaching into my curriculum. Now I have the opportunity to work
with Union
whereby they will supervise and meet
out an arrangement under their College practice teaching field program. They asked
your that requirements 1t be worked through and that appropriate eredit be given by Southern
Missionary College since the one subject would not establich a residency
at Uaion College.
Briefly the conditions are as follows: Union College has a practice teaching
field program where their teachers go out to the various academies throughout the
the union and work with experienced teachers. Dr. Eugene Gascay makes are
errangements and sees that qualified supervision and proper requirements
met.
I would
teach the Bookkeeping class. This
Here at Plainview Academy
practice
who bas his
in Business
would be under the supervision of our principal
director degree of teaching
and Accounting, and a Masters in education. Dr. Gascay,
practice, has kindly consented to oversée the supervision.
regarding these arrangements, please contact
If there are furtheriquestions.
Dr. Gascay or G. P. Stone of Union Collage.
