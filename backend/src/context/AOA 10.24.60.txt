Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Schneider: :
Dr. John R. Jones of Chattanooga and I thoroughly
enjoyed our visit with you and members of your science department
last Monday. I was very much impressed with the great strength of
your departments of biology and chemistry. Your faculty in these
departments would make a college with three times your enrollment
exceedingly proud. By the way, I mentioned Southern Missionary
with a few of my impressions of the college at several of the
educational meetings, which I addressed in Tennessee last week.
Under separate cover, I am sending you some information
about the osteopathic profession and its educational program and
I hope that you will distribute some of this literature to the
several professors whom we met.
Dr. Jones and Dr. Pettit will be in touch with you
somet time in the near future to make arrangements to meet with your
science group.
Many thanks, again, for taking time out from a busy
day to be with us last week.
Very truly yours,
WPMill
