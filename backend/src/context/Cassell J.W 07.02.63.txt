Berrien Springs, Michigan
Dear Elder Smith:
Iwould like to take this opportumity to express my appreciation for
your kind letter of Juhe 11. It is always good to know that your work
is appreciated by thosen with whom you have had the opportunity to
work. It is always hard to leave one's friends but new opportunities
do come that appear to present a challenge.
Charlotte and I have already learned to appreclate this very beautiful
spot. I believe we will enjoy our term of service here very much.
Truly we did enjoy the eight years that we spent at Berrien Springs.
We leamed to love the institution and made many lasting friendships.
Possibly we will again have the opportunity of working in the Lake
Union Conference.
I trust that you will convey my feeling of appreciation to the Board for
allowing me to finish my graduate work while employed by the university.
Certainly the Board has been very kind to me.
Should you land Mrs. Smith pass this way, we trust that you will contact
us. We shall look forward to seeing you again.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
