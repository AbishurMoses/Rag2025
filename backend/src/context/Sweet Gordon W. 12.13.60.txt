Dear President Rees:
The Commit ttee on Standards and Reports has exami ned
your 1960 report on standards and found it satisfactory
with the exception of the report on Standard 19.
The commi ttee requested that the institution make a
follow-up study of its report on Standard 19. This
should summarize a reasonable sampling of the progress
made over the past five years by your graduates in a
fair distribution of graduate and professional schools.
This report should be available for the visiting com-
mi ttee when you have completed your Institutional Self-
Study.
Colleges participating in the Institutional Self-Study
and Periodic Visitation Program according to a schedule
approved by this office report on all standards as
specified in the Manual and do not submit reports to
the office on any selected standards. The full report
on all standards is held for the committee visit. Forms
for reporting enrollment will be sent to you during the
summer.
A11 of us in the Commission office send you greetings
for a happy holiday season and best wishes for a success-
ful year ahead in your insti tution.
Cordially youy
dus.
Gordon W. Sweet
Executive Secretary
