Dear Mr. Iles:
In checking the smsrofh√©oatrilatore to our scho larship
fund, we have come to your name which is also listed in
our college bulletin as an annual contributor in the amount
of $250. This gift to our scho larship fund has been greatly
appreciated. Every year we have students in need. It is
not our intent to bring pressure to bear upon any scholar-
ship contributors, but we would be very pleased if you could
again this year provide a $250 scholar rship for a needy student .
Thank you sincerely for this assistance and if you find it
possible to repeat this year, it will make some students
very hap ppy.
Very sincerely yours,
