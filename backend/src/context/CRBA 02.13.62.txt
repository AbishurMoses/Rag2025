Dear Brother Schneider:
In looking through your prospective graduates list for 1962,
I notice there are not very many young ladies who are fin-
ishing the Business Administration course. We are in need
of an accountant, preferably a woman. I notice Sandra J.
Vinson, who is interested in work in an accounting office
as a choice of employment. If there is a possiblity that
she would be interested in moving into "Yankee" territory in
the Mid-west, I W ould appreciate receiving information as to
her background, experience, etc. and any other items of in-
terest to a potential employer.
As you know, the Christian Record is a denominational print-
ing house for Blind People, and if she is interested in de-
nominational employment, there is a possibility that things
might work out to our mutual satisfaction.
Sincerely,
CHRIATIAN RECORD BENEVOLENT ASSOCIATION
