Maitland, Florida
Dear Miss Illick:
I have had opportunity to check your file and read the correspondence
between you and Doctor Schneider. I believe I can understamd the
problem that you have faced in trying to get employment.
I assure you I will do all that I can do be of assistance to you.should -
someone write to me for information. Even though we wish it were
not s0, many times hospitalization for an emotional problem does
cause a certain stigma in some peoples minds. This is unfortunate
and I believe that we should do all that we can to over come this
prejudice.
I would be most happy to send along the statement from Doctor
Winston should someone write to me for a recommendation.
IfI may be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
