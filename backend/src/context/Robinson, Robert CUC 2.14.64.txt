Dear Dr. Casselli:
Columbia Union College was honored to be the host to the delega tions
of five academic sections during the past summer. The sections were:
Agriculture, Business Adminis tration, Home Bconomics, Industrial Arts,
and Secretarial Science.
The minutes of the sections are now being distributed, Your copy
will reach you shortly. A copy is a 1so being sent to each delega te
who attended. A few addiitiona. 1 copies of the minutes ha ve been
printed. So if there are others on your faculty who you feel should
ha ve a copy of the minutes we would be happy to send them a copy too,
--as long as theysupply lasts. A note indicating their name and
the seci tion they would be interested in will take care of it.
Your delega tes were kept very busy, as you will be able to tell from
the Agenda which is being sent wi th the Minutes. Many of the delega tes
ha ve said that t it was the most profitable session they ha ve attended,
We hope, through the enc. losed minutes, we may share some of this benefit
with you.
Very sinc erely,
Robert J. Robinson
Assistant Business Manager
