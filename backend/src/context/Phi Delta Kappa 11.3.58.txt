Mr. Robert P. O'Hara, President
Iota Chapter, Phi Deita Kappa
7 Kirkland Street
Cambridge 38, Massachusetts
Deaz Mr. O'Hara:
A day or so ago I received your communication of recent date
with regard to membership in the Iota Chapter of the Phi Delta
Kappa. I had supposed that I was long since forgotten as it
is now a number of years since I did hold membership in your
Chapter. Since that time, however, I have spent two years in
a college on the Esland of Jamaica and now an beginning ay
third year here at Southern Missionary Coliege where I an
serving as acedenic dean.
Having neglected y responsibilities totrard the Chapter for
so long, I hardly feel it in order to renew my membership
and especially so since I an now at a considerable distance
from Massachusetts. If I vere to join a chapter it would
naturally be at some closer point such as Chattanooga or
Nashville.
I appreciate the fact that you sti1l have my nane o0 your
list, but I am afraid I have been a very poor member of tine
organization, for even when I was in Massachusetts my progran
was so confining that I was able to get away only once or
twice to attend a meeting of the chapter.
Thanking you for your kind interest, I an
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
