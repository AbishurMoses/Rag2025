College Place, Washington
Dear Lila:
In planning our Mathematics program for the future, we aze interested
in bringing another qualified man within a year or two. We have a lead
on a young man who is presently working on his doctorate program but
he is a severe cripple and we wonder how he would be able to stand up
to a black board most of the day teaching mathematics.
The name of a Mr. Gentry has come to us who is presently teaching
at Georgia Teci. while he is working on his doctorate program. We
believe that Mr. Gentry taught at Walla Walla College approximately
two years ago and it is for this reason that I am writing you. Would
you give us a very frank appraisal of Mr. Gentry's ability to teach
mathematics and his disposition to get along with people. Perhaps you
can also give us some indication of what kind of an Adventist he is.
We wouid appreciate this information by return mail.
The weather has been more severe here than usual but nothing df the
Kind that they have been experiencing elsewhere. We have had very
litele snow and of course that which we have had has delighted the
students, expecially those from Miami, Florida. Tunderstand that
EMC has had over 70 inches of snow and it is difficuit to find enough
room to pile the snow. I suppose you have had some this winter but
of course spring is close at hand.
I wish it were possible for all of us to get together again this summer
but this may not be our privilege. We rather hope to make our way out
to the Jackson Hole country after our administrators meeting at Union
Coilege. We hope to camp there for a few days following the ninth of
August. We would certainly appreciate seeing any of you good people
from Walla Walla. Come join us at that time.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
