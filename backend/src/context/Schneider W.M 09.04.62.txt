Dear Mr. Smith:
Southern Missionary College has participated in the National 1
Bducational Defense Loan program for students during the past
two years. Enclosed please note an application which you may
file with our Student Loans and Scholarship Committee should
you wish to apply for such a loan. The maximum amount which a
student may zeceive during any one year here at Southern
Missionary College is $500. I believe the average last year
was around $360. Although the Federal Government permits us
to 1oan up to a $1,000 annually to any one student, our Board
has taken action limiting the amount to $500 which permits us
to take care of the needs of more students.
We do not loan funds to freshmen until they wi1l have had an
opportunity to establish themselves on this campus. Generally
speaking the student will show his qualifications during the
first nine weeks of the school year. The grade point average
which we hold to is 1.5 which represents a "C4" or "B-".
The interest rate of three per cent does not take effect until
one year after the student has completed college or quit schoo1l,
whichever the case may be. The student has a period of ten
years in which to repay the loan, although the college is
interested in retrieving the funds at an earlier date in order
to help other students.
I believe the above covers the essentials of the loan and
should you have any further questions, please let us hear
from you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
