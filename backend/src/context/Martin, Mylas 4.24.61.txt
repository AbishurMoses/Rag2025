Dear Mr. Martin:
Thank you for your letter of April 17, in which you
request information concerning potential e, lementary school
teachers and also secondary teachers prepared to meet
certification requirements.
A11 of our seniors prepared to teach in the elementary
school have been placed, and it appears that we are unable to
assist you wita your needs. If we graduated three times as
many teachers as we do presently, the needs would still be
greater than the supply.
Thank you again for writing us in regard to your needs.
Very sincere 1y yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider

Sirs:
We have a teaching vacancy this fall at Ramah Junior Academy, the
150-pupil church school operated by two Seventh-Day Adventist
churches in Cleveland.
Can you send us, by return mail, information about your graduating
seniors who have prepared themselves for teaching careers?
We are interested in any outstanding senior, preferably Neg gro, who
has ma, jored or minored in elementary or secondary e ducation, one
who can meet certirication requirements.
But we are doubly interested
in a young man or woman in the sciences who plans to make a career
of teaching.
Thank you.
Very truly yours,
