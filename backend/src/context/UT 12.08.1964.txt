Dear Dr. Cassell:
I wish to thank you for the privilege of meeting you and
members of your science faculty dur ing the recent visit of
our Committee on your campus .
Our call at Southern Missionary College was altogether
enjoyable and informative. We were pleased to note the efforts
you are making in the several areas of pre-professional training.
It seemed to us a S: incere interest was shown both by your faculty
and by students with whom we had an opportunity to meet. I was
personally pleased, of course, that some of your students are
following a pre-pharmacy curriculum.
I am enc. los: ing two copies each of a brochure and a survey of
comparative salaries of recent college graduates in pharmacy and
various other fields. You may wish to post copies of these on
your bulletin board for the information of interested students.
Mr. Eugene Tragesser, Director of Admissions for the Medical
Units, will no doubt be in further contact with you in regard to
the visit by our Committee. In the meantime please accept my
personal thanks for the courtesies extended. If the College of
Pharmacy can be of any service to you, please call on us.
S: incerely yours,
