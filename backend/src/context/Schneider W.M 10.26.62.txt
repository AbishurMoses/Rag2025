Dear Mrs. Smith:
Enclosed is a National Defense Student Loan Application
for your use. According to your card written to Mr.
Ackerman, we understand that your daughter is planning to
come to Southern Missionary College as of second semester.
You may complete the application form and send it in and we
shall keep it on file until your daughter will have had the
opportunity of establishing herself. Perhaps it would be well
to explain that we do not as a rule extend Government Loans
to freshmen until they will have had a chance to establish
themselves on this campus. A year ago we made some
exceptions to the policy and unfortunately some of the students
did not do well scholastically or socially. For this reason we
are waiting nine weeks until the student has had a chance to
discover his college potential.
In checking our files, we note that your daughter has not as
yet applied for admission. Enclosed is an application blank
which she should complete and return at an early date. It
will be necessary for us to secure her transcripts from
institutions formerly attended and character references. As
soon as this material is in hand, we shall process the application.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
