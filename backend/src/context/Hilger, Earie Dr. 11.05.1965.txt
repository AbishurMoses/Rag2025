Andrews University
Berrien Spriags, Michigan
Dear Brother Hilgert:
I have on hand your letter of October 28 making inquiry conceraing
a forthcoming visit to the campus to fellowship with the religion majors
who are interested fa attending the Seminary next year,
I have taken occasion to contact the Religion Department and find
that it will certainly be most convenient for you and Dr. Pease to visit
the campus Friday througla Monday, December 3 to 6, for the above-
mentioned purpose. 11 believe that Brother Bennett will be off campus
Friday but will be here Sunday so you will have a good opportunity to
contact him as well as the other members of the department.
I wish 1e were possible to use you foik for some public appoint-
ments over the week end but in looking at the calendar I find that week
end has been assigned to Elder Stanley Will, who will be promoting the
Sabbath school during the Friday evening service and also the Sabbath
morning services. In all probability it will aiso be the week end we go
into the new church,
All of us look forward to your visit.
Most cordially yours,
C. N. Rees
Pxesident
