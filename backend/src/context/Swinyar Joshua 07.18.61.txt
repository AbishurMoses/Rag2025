Dear Dr. Schneider:
In a conversation with Mrs. Floyd Marvin yesterday she
indicated the possibility of attending S.M.C., this
coming fall. No doubt there was a bit of apprehen sion
on your part since she has been divorced from her hus-
band, as to whethe r she was a memb er of the church in
good and regular standing subsequent to the action.
About two years or more ago, Mr. Marvin moved out of
the home and took up residence First in Fort Smith,
Arkansas, and then later at Keene, Texas. After having
established residence in Texas Mr. Marvin stated that
he was desirous of obtaining a separation and asked Mrs.
Marvin to grant him an uncontested divorce, Which she
did. There was an equitable settlement of the property
and assets and Sister Marvin's actions have at all times
met the approval of our church board and the academy
with whom she was employed. There seems to be a soften-
ing on the part of Mr. Marvin in recent weeks and we
hope that this is an indication of a change of heart in
preparation for a reconciliation. At any rate, there
would be no need for re: servation where Mrs. Marvin is
con cerned as she has been faithful to the church and
its standards throughout the entire period of upset.
Should you see my brother, CO nvey our greetings to him
and his family, even if it only cons sists of yelling
down the hill and stating thai b we said "Hi. -
Sinperely yours in His service,
A
Elder Jo shua Swinyar
