Dear Mr. Stevens:
Eo viozeonis vIsV
Mr. Don West referred your letter of February 18 to me since my
office is responsible for placement of our graduates.
Miss Fikes is planning to be married and do√®s not desire placement.
I realize the tremendous need for SecretarintSclence teachers, but
ie seems that we camot get many of these people placed before they
get to the alter. Miss Files has done very well in her practice

teaching and we feel she would make a good teacher. However, her
husband to be will still be in college here for another two years
emaofons
which means that she willlind employment in the azea.
We do have Ewo majors in English who are seeking employment. One
is Nancy Steadman who has a major in English, a minor in History
and is fully certified.
The other is Douglas Allen Walker. He has a major in English and
a minor in religion. He is also fully certified.
You will find both of these young people pictured in our placement
brochure. I would suggest that you get in touch with them personally
should you have an interest in either one. Miss Steadman resides
in the Women's Residence Hall. The phone number is 396-2195 and
Mr. Walker zesides in the Men's Residence Hall and the phone number
is 396-2202.
We do not have any Spanish majors this year but will have two or
three graduating next year. I am sorry we cannot give you much
