Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Clark:
I am writing you relative to our college tour of the
Northeastern States in 1960. After we boarded the bus for
the trip, Dr. Shankel stated that I would be auditing the
course. I suppose he did that since I already had my Master's
degree. At that time I did not realize that I would need the
credit for renewal of my state certificate. Just recently I
made a request to the college for credit upon my paying the
difference of the tuition, but I was denied it by the
Academic Policies Committee.
If you feel that my request could be granted without
hindering the standing of the college, I should be glad for
you to contact Dean Cassell. I need only two college hours of
credit. Frankly, I feel that I got as much or more benefit
from the trip than any of the others, for I thoroughly enjoyed
the trip. It was one I had been looking forward to for
I know I did not take the examination, but I never refused years. to
take it. I have credit on other courses where no examination
was required.
I hear of you occasionally through some of my former
students. I am glad that our college is moving forward. I
hope to visit there soon.
Sincepely,
Jesse Jones
