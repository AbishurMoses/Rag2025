Hinsdale Sanitarium and Hospital
Hinsdale, Illinois
Dear Brother Havley:
We appreciated your visit to the campus and although it
may not have netted nurses for your institution, I an
sure that repeat visits will make an impression, especially
on such as may not be tied to the Florida Sanitarium and
Hospital on the basis of scholarship funds.
The cafeteria sent through a voucher in the amount of $7.12
to be charged to the Department of Nursing. Inasnuch as this
was to be charged to the Hinsdale Saniterium and
I
an forwarding the voucher to you for collection. Hospital, In making
payment, would you kindly indicate on the stub that the
amount should be credited to the cafeterie.
Please give Guy Stewart my personal regards.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
