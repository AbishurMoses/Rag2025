Mr. Clarence Miller, Administrator
Loma Linda Sanitarium and Hospitai
Loma Linda, California
Dear Clarence:
One of our young men by the name of Ronald Pickel, who wi1l
be graduating from the field of business this spring, is very
much interested in pursuing work which will eventually lead
to hospital administration. He is very much interested in
an internship such as Loma Linda devised a year ago.
Mr. Pickel has a very fine personality and is most cooperative
in all respects. He is not chiefly interested in accounting
and would perhaps fi1l the bill best if given the chance
eventually to go into personnel work.
Should you have available an intership, Mr. Pickel would be
very interested in applying.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
