Dear Miss Mickelwright:
I appreciate you coming to SMC to visit with us today. Enclosed
you will find a check to assist in the espense involved.
I do hope you will give this some serious consideration for there
is a real opportunity here for you if you are interested in teaching,
as well as a need to offer a topnotch program in physical education
for the young women at SMC.
We feel that you are well qualifled for your experience as well as
your background educationally to meet this need. Should you decide
to join us next fall, we would be most anxious to work with you on
further graduate work. In fact, should you be able to get some
work in Birmingham or in the nearby area this summer, we would
be interested in assisting you as well.
We shall look forward to hearing from you further concerning your
plans.
Sincerely yours,
