Chattanooga, Tennessee
Dear Rabbi Swift:
Since your visit here we have been studying our
schedule of events for the next three weeks with
a view to finding a possible opening to visit
your remarkable museum. However, it seems
impossible at this late date with the many
matters crowding in near the close of the term.
We do wish to thank you for your generous offer
which I hope we may find possible to accept at
an early date during the next college term.
The students and teachers deeply appreciated
your challenging and inspiring address.
Most sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
