Mr. Jack Shull, Principal
Mount Vernon Acadeny
Mount Vernon, Obio
Dear Mr. Shuli:
Since your appearance to this campus, I have had the
opportuity to speak to Ken Kissinger about the possibility
of an opening at Mount Vernon Acadeny as your assistant in
the accounting office. There was an immedinte interest, and
if anything develops, I wish to say again that you camnot do
better eisewhere than to secure the services of this man.
Ohio is his hone state, and you wi1l find him capabie
and also congenial. He will have no problens in the business
office in working with students.
Recently the Hinsdale Sanitarium and Hospital offered hin
a job as night billez, which consists of posting the patients'
ledger during the night hours. Mr. Kissinger feels that with
his family obligations and a1l, it would be best for him not
to accept woxk of that nature. He can remain on the job here
as office manager for the McKee Bakery Company as long as
necessary with a good salary. but he is anious to get into
denominational work, and I believe he is not too choosy at this
time. He is ancious for academy office work, and 1f you have
a need in the future, you will do we1l to th ink of him.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
