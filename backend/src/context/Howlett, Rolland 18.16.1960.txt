Wa tsonville, California
Dear Mr. Howlett:
Your letter to Dr. Shankel was referred to me in as
much as I suceeded hin as academic dean here at Southern Miss-
ionary College.
The loss of your printing teacher due to a heart attack
is to be regretted. This is a personal loss to the
involved and also a loss of talent much needed on our family
campuses.
I have inquired of others concerning the availability
of a printing teacher, and several have referred ne to
Mr. James Lynn. I understand that Mr. Lynn is presently
enrolled in the mathematics workshop at Emmanuel Missionary
College, and that last year he taught at Pisgah Academy.
AS far as we know he is not re turning to Pisgab and it
be that he would be available for your school. The men may here
feel that he is very capable both in printing and in math.
Perhaps he has not been as mat ture in the past as he could
have been, but there are those here who feel that he has now
grown up and would do a goodljob. This is merely a
and it is possible that you could contact hin through suggestion
Emmanuel Missionary College.
If we can be of any further assistance to you, please
let us hear from you again.
Veryhsincerely yours,
W. M. Schneider

Mr. G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tenn.
Dear Mr. Shankel:
We lost our printing teacher from a heart attack in
June. We are endeavoring to find a qualified man who
could teach Printing I and II, with certification,
and operate a small letterpress and off-set plant.
We have a large Multilith and a smaller one as well,
together with plate-making equipment. We do our own
work for the school and whatever commercial work comes
in to us.
If you have any recommendations for anyone, I would
appreciate your phoning me collect. I would also
appreciate your checking with your manager of the press
to see if he could furnish us any leads.
May I hear from you soon.
Sincerely,
K. H. euelet
