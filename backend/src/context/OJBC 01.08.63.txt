Dear Mr. Iles:
We sincerely appreciate the scholarship funds in the amount of
$250. The Student Loans and Scholarship Committee has voted to
present this scholarship to Mr. William Kealy, who is a married
student and came to us the second semester of last year. Mr. Kealy
is working hard to make ends meet and at the same time his
scholastic performance is excellent. He will undoubtedly write you
a word as he finds time. Thank you again for this financial assistance
to a young man on our campus.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
