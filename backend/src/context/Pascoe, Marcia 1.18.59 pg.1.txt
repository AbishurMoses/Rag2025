Dear Marcia:
I have your letter of recent date regarding information for
prospective missionaries, I an certainly happy to know that you
are soneuhat interested in going to a mission field sone day, for
there is a great need in this respect, and not too many young
people today are interested in giving their lives in self-sacri-
ficing nork in renote places of the earth. Having spent 20 years
in foreign fieids nyself, I an naturally very sympathetic with
those that have anbitions along this line, for when I was in high
school I also had foreign missions in mind, and wben the opportunity
came I lost no time In accepting the call to go.
Mission service is not only a great and unsel 1fish calling but it
is also a most rewerding work, for it opens up newr understanding
of other people and other nations and gives people a much better
comprehension of the world's problens and how they are to be
solved.
I also te1l my college students during recent years that if everyone
could have the opportumity of spending a fewr years in foreign fields
in mission service that we Americans would have an altogether
different outlook on the solution of these problems.
I am not sure that I know just what kind of information you are
needing because every church has its oten information which it gives
out to those of its young people who are interested in foreign mission
service. The headquarters of each religious institution ssually
has a little leaflet oE pamphlet that gives a greet deal of infor-
mation to the peopie of the organization, and I would suggest
therefore that you write to the headquarters of your organization
for such information. This wi1l naturally vary according to the
church involved.
If there is any specific information which you need concerning
the world fields I would be very happy to help you further. I
