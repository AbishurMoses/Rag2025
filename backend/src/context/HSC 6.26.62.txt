Dear Mr. McKim:
We are sorry that it is not possible for us to send you
confidential papers pertaining to Miss Marilyn Biggs.
The college has not followed the practice of assembling.a
brochure for each of its graduates. We are always happy,
however, to convey any information which the employing
organization desires to have.
Miss Biggs graduated here with a Bachelor of Science in
elementary teacher education. She achieved a grade point
average of 1.49 based on the systemo of allowing three points
for an "A" grade. I would class Miss Biggs as a very
average student with a fine character. Her character is
beyond reproach. She could have been a better student in
some of the solid subjects but I believe she worked to
capacity.
Should you wish any specific information, please let us hear
from you and we sha11 get it to you immediately.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
