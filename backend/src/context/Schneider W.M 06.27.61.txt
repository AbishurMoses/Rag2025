Dear Madan:
We have your card indicating that we have not responded to
your questionnaire in regard to camp placement services.
I am not sure whether I understand what is meant by your
term camp placement service.
We provide no service through. our: Placement, Bureau pertaining
to camp placement. If you have reference to summer camps
operated by colleges or other organizations, we must say that
there is little we do to service camps.
This is a church-related college and it has been the practice
of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to operate youth camps in
various parts of the country. Most every state in the South
contains such a camp, but this is sponsored by the church
organization and not the college.
If we can be of further assistance, please let us hear from
you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

P. S. I am unable to locate the questionnaire which was sent
to us.
