Des ar Doctor Cassel:
May I a ssume that your silence means you will not
be asking me to fill the po: sition in the elementary school?
Time is running short, and I do not want to hold off
some of the other possibilities for work for next year .
Also, I am informed that my mother must be placed in a
nursing home as soon as pos: sible.
Would you kindly let me know pro or con as soon as
possible?
Sincerely yours,
Tha
