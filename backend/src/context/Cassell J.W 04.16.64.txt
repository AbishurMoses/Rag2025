Mr.W. A Sowers, Principal
Oak Park Academy
Box 209
Nevada, Iowa
Dear Mr. Sowers:
We appreciate your interest in our graduates and wish it were possible
for us to give you a wider choice of potential mathematic-science
teachers for your academy.
We do have one graduate who haso not yet been placed and who might
be interested in placement in Iowa. I am enclosing the placement
folder for him and would appreciate it if you would return it to me
when you have finished with it.
Unfortunately he is not certified to teach and would probably have to
have additional work in education in order to meet Iowa certification
requirements.
Mr. Mitzelfelt is a biology major with minors in religion and social
science. He is married and has two children. He lists teaching as
one of his choices af work. He is a rather shy retiring individual
and I would have some question about his teaching ability.
You are certainly free to contact him. He does not have a phone but
you could reach him by calling my number at 396-2271. If you should
plan to visit the campus, we will be very happy to arrange an appoint-
ment with him for you.
Best wishes to you.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
