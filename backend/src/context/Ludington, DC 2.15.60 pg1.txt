Dear Dr. Shankel,
Your letter of the 10th has just been received
and we are always glad to hear from friends at
Collegedale.
Ne will really miss Elder Beckner, but
of course we cannot expect to have our ministers remain
always in one place. I am sure he will do well in
his netr work.
I an not just sure when we will be leaving
here for Tennessee. Our plans now are to leave about
the middle of April and we lan to stay with Clifford
in Dunlan until a, out the close of school. le would
like to be at Collegedale for camp meeting sO as to
see many of our friends and also enjoy the meetings.
If you did not mind we could stay in one of our beds
and do a little cooking while you are away, or at
least for a. part of the time.
I mention this
because you offered us that privilege a yoar ago hen
we mere there.
I am so glad to hear the good reports of
the school there. We were there so Long that the
school is just like one of our own children. I
have worked for the school. almost since it started.
It is a real thrill. to meet our former students all
over the world and especially hsre in California. We
meet them in almost every church we attend here.
ith kind regards, I remain
Your sincere fri a and Brother,
C udmmgion
