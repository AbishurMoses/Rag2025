Miss Jean Smith
130 W. Henderson Street
Salisbury, North Carolina
Dear Miss Smith:
I am pleased to learn of your plans to attend the Math and Art
Workshops at Southern Missionary College this july. We shall look
forward to having you as a student.
It would be possible for you to live in the dormitory, but since you
will be needing to fix your o meals, I would suggest that you write
to Mr. Kenneth Spears, Director of Student Finance at Southern
Missionary College, and request a one bedroom apartment with
kitchen facilities. I imagine it would be possible for Mr. Spears
to axrange such accommodations for you. In the event, that does
not work out satisfactorily, I would suggest that you write to Miss
Bvaline West, Dean of Women at Southern Missionary College, and
request the use of the snack kitchen during the two-week workshops.
As soon as you knowr when you will be arriving on campus, you should
contact Mr. Gordon Madgwick, Dean of Students, and request to be
met at the bus station. Iam sure Mr. Madgwick would be happy to
make arrangements for you.
Iam enclosing an application blank which you should fill out and
return to Dr. Cyril Futcher, Director of Admissions.
I you should have any further questions or if I may be of any assistance
to you, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
