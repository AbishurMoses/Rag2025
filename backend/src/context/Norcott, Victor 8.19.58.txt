Dear Brother Norcott:
This seems like an echo of bygone days to be looking over your credits
once again. I received them just this morning after answering
Elder Dick;s letter yesterday and saying I would be able to give
a better evaluation if I had the transcripts at hand. I did not
know from his letter that they were coming.
Nat turally our colleges here in America are somewhat conservative
in evaluating credits taken either in the University of South
Africa or Buropean institutions, but I should say a conservative
estimate of your work would be about as follows: Home Study
credits--aycholory. 3 hours; Sociology, 3 hours; Tropical School
of Medicine--16 hours by the most conservative estimate; University
French I, 8 hours; University French II, 8 hours; University French
III, 10 hours; University English I, 8 hours; University English
II, 10 hours; University History, 8 hours; University Education,
6 hours. The work taken at Hel lderberg College would naturally be
evaluated at 64 hours since it was a junior college at that time.
The transcript for the sociology course was not included in the
papers you sent, but I assume that you can present papers for the
sociology from the Home Study Institute. This would make a total
of 80 hours in addition to the 64 hours taken at Helderberg, or a
total of 144 hours, which of course would be considerably more
than necessary for a bachelor's degree.
The only requirement in our bachelor of arts course that you have
not met would be four hours of fine arts which would be either art
or music. Otherwise, you would have completed a1l the requirements
for a degre√© here except the regulation that one must take 24 hours
in residence in order to get his degree from a college in the states.
You probably have enough French to offer for a major in French and
almost enough education to offer a major in education, so you would
have no trouble with a major and minor. Now it is just the question
of a residence requirement.
