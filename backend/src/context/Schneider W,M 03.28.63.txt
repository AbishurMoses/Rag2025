Dear Daisy:
Under separate cover we are mailing you a class schedule for this
year and also a bulletin. I have re-written the entire bulletin for
another year but the section pertaining to Home Economics will be
much the same.
We certainly hope that you will give serious consideration to coming
here. Obviously we have a personal reason from a friendship point of
view. You wouid enjoy this beautiful valley and also the fine camaraderie
as you associate with the rest of the staff. We have an excellent staff
and everyone works together as one unit.
As we mentioned over the telephone, if we can interest Alma in
continuing her work towards the master's degree, we would endeavor
to secure a grant for her. It would be a real joy to have some of our
long-time friends with us. Our collegiate school of nursing is moving
ahead rapidly and we are very proud to announce that our junior class
stood well above the nacional norm on the N.L.N, tests which they took
recently.
Come join us and we will see to it that you have a pleasant experience
here at Southern Missionary College. Please give Alma and the
Sonnenbergs our personal regards.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M, Schneider
Academic Dean
