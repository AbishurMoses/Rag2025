Dear Miss Stonebumer:
Iam writing in response to your letter of September 16 in which you
inquire concerning our Health Education program at Southern Missionary
College. We do teach a course entitled Health and Life which is a general
education requirement and is thus required of all students at Southern
Missionary College. We are taking a different approach to this course this
year since we have felt that it has not been too effective in the past. We
are using a team teaching approach on an experimental basis, thus we are
not using a text book. We have.purchased a large number of textbooks
and other resource materials which we have placed in our college library
on a reserve basis.
Since we are using a team teaching approach, each subject is presented
by a faculty member who is well qualified in his specialized field. We
are watching this program very carefully this year and are working very
closely in a coordinating committee with the teachers involved. At the
present time we are quite excited about the interest that has been
generated among the students enrolled in the course. We believe this
has real possibilities.
At the present time we do not offer a major or minor in health or health
education. We do have a major in Health and Physical Education bur the pri-
mary emphasis here is in the fleld of Physical Bducation.
I trust this will serve to answer questions posed in your letter.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
