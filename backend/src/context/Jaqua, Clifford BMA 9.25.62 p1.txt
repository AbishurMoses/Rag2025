Mr. Ciifford L. Jaqua, Principal
Bass Memorial Academy
Lumberton, Mississippi
Dear Mr. Jaqua:
Your letter to the registrar concerning the problen which you
have with several of your staff members in trying to get them
certified was referred to me. I have taken up this matter with
the Academic Policies Committee and although they feel that you
woul 1d be competent in supervising a program for Mr. Ralph
Peterson and Mr. Loren Bishop in order to secure the hours
necessary for certification, we feel that such a practice
would be impossible inasmuch as it would be opening the door
rather widely to poor academic procedure. It would mean that
teachers a1l over the field could secure hours of credit in
directed teaching when under the observation of qualified
individuals in theiz respective institutions.
I am sure that you can umderstand that our institution would
hardiy be able to engage in such a program. When the institution
is called upon to give credit, it must provide the supervision
if its program is going to be at all acceptable. Otherwise it
would have to establish extension facilities which would mean
the listing of personne. 1 from all over the field in our college
bulletin. Our comittee was very much apposed to such a practice
even though they considered your qualifications as very acceptable.
We wish we could be of help to you in this instance but will have
to decline because of the precedent involved.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schne ider
Academic Dean
