Dear Mr. Harris:
I am very sorry that I did not have the opportunity of meeting you
personally when you visited the campus recently.
I did present your request to the Academic Policies Committee a few
days ago and I am happy to inform you that your request to have your
transcript amended to show withdrawal rather than fai flure for the
courses taken the second semester of 1953 was granted. It would not
be posslble, however, for us to permit you to take tests over the
courses you were taking at that time and get credit for those courses.
The time that has intervened between would make this impossible. I
am sure you can undexstand our position in this matter. I trust this
action by the Academic Policies Committee will be helpful to you as
you continue your college education.
Iwould like to take this opportumity to wish you success in this
endeavor. If you should have any further questions, please feel
free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean

Dear Dean Cassell;
Unfortunately you were attending a Faculty Meeting during my visit to the
Campus yesterday and I did not have the pleasure of meeting with jou as
previously planned. Your assistant, Mr. Futcher, however was very cordial
and informative in disoussing the subject of my credits.
As I mentioned to Mr. Futcher, I an considering completing my formal
education at night school in the Atlanta area and wish to "clear up 1
my umpretentious transcript.
At a glance my glaring record at Collegedale might indicate other than
a true impression of the indiyidual. There were extenuating circumstances
surrounding my "failures" for thel last Semester I attended SMC.
Briefly, my "failures" represent a "Wi thdrawal" rather than a failure, in
the true sense of the word. During those last school days of the second
Semester of 1953 my "world; at the timey came tumbling down with the
disclosure of an unfai thful wife.
This disclosure completely disoriented me at the time. It was examination
week for second 5 emester. Due to the humiliating personal circumstanoes
I failed to appear for my examinations and consequently received the
grades now recorded on my transeript.
Several of your staff members were at Collegedale at the time and may
recall this incident. Mrs. Brown, of Camp Road, was my Landlady at the
time. Mr Fleming may also recall the incident. Professor Stien consoled
with my ex-wife and I and recommended the termination of the marriage.
Considering the above pertinent information it is my request that my
(
transcript be amended to show Wi thdrawal" rather than "Failure" for
those courses taken the Second S emester of 1953.
I also discussed wi th Brother Futcher the possibilty of getting credit
for those courses now recorded as Failure. He discouraged the idea, however
if there were ANY way possible that I could be tested etc. that would
allow me to receive grades and credit for those subjects, then I would NO
be most grateful and appreciatkve.
May I hear from you please.
Sincerly,
Sluhar h. Ganis
