College of Medical Evangelists
Loma Linda, California
Dear John:
So very sorry to learn of your recent heart attack but rejoice with you
that the Lord spared your life.. It is our understanding tha t you were involved
in some physical activity at the time the incident occurred. One could
readily biame it on exercise, but knowing what our sedentary programs are
like, I would blame it more on the lack of physical exercise.
We are so happy that you are still with us and hope that your progress
is satisfactory.
While soliciting for the college's foundation in the city of Detroit, I
met an ex-banker who had a similar experience to yours. He informed me that
in the city of Detroit they have organized a coronary club which included
a1l businessmen who have had a heart attack and came through successfully.
There is one bit of information that he gave me which may be good for you, too.
He was enjoying life far more than he had ever enjoyed it before because he
was beginning to understand life a little bit more. There was some work
involved, but the members of this club often met on the golf course to exchange
a few putts. His program a Iso included a well-balanced dietary schedule with
at least 9 hours of rest every night. With this type of a program, life took
on a new hue for him and he said that the members of this club had never been
happier.
Perhay ps the nine-hour night for you would also be a good prescription. I
wish it were possible for a1l of us.
Again, let me say we are so glad that you are still with us and hope that
your recovery wi1l be complete.
Very cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
