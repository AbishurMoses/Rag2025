Nashville, Tenmessee
Dear President Millet:
Your letter addressed to Dr. Walters is on my desk
for a reply. Dr. Walters is not here at the present moment
so I an answering in his absence. In any case, Dr. Walters
is no longer in the employ of Southern Missionary College.
Further, may I say that Mr. Krogstad is at Washington,
D. C., at the present and is connected with Mashington
Missionary College so his name would be out of the question.
Our band leader at the present time is Mr. Burton Jackson
but I fear that it would be impossible for us to spare
him for. one day a week for band as he is pretty well tied
up in the program here. We are sorry that we cannot favor
you in this way, but, in any case, it is Mr. Krogstad
that you were wishing and not Mr. Jacksen.
Trusting that this will answer your question fully,
I am
Sincerely yours,
G. B. Shankel
Dean
