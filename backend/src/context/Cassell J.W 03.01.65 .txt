Dear Elder Stannard:
Possibly you have heard by now that Ruth Hayes is home. She did very
well the first semester but began to show signs of emotional problems
during test week and prior to the beginning of the second semester. We
advised her to take a semester at home and then try to return either in
the summer or next fall provided she is feeling better.
Ruth has had a lot of emotional and mental difficulties but is showing
signs of progress. I do have some serious doubt about the advisabllity
af her continuing in the field of elementary education. Ruth is probably
never going to be able to withstand the pressure that comes from the
classroom situation. We have counseled her toward food service
preparation or some other type of work that would be less anxiety
producing. At the present time, however, she is quite determined to
complete her work in elementary education although sh√® is not sure
now that she will go into teaching following graduation. She is a very
fine girl and very deserving of any financial assistance that can be
given her.
Since she is not in attendance at this time, Iam returning the scholarship
check for $400 that was recently sent to the college. Iassume this will
either be held for her when she returns to continue her education or given
to someone else this semester. Please let us know your thoughts on the
matter. I think it would be quite a blow to Ruth if she were to feel that
she had been cut off financially by the conference. Consequently, I believe
it would be well to let things remain as they are until we see what progress
Ruth makes at home this semester.
IEI may be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
