Dear Professor Poggerburg:
Our department heads met last night at a fellowship dinner and nominated
the following students for Woodrow Wilson National Fellowahips. The
faculty had been thoroughly informed concerning the procedure and told
to recommend to their department head the name or names af any students
who they felt could qualify for this award.
We believe the following students exemplify those traits of character,
personality, and scholarship that would ematre their success in graduate
school.
Arthur Richert, Jr. will graduate in June, 1965 with a major in Mathematics
and Physics.
Douglas Allen Wallkez will also graduate in June, 1965 with a major in
English.
Luane Sue Logan will grraduate in June, 1965 with a major in Music.
Bailey Emerson Winstead gradunted last June, 1964 with a major in
History. He is presently teaching in a local high school II believe.
You may write to all df these individuais at Collegedale, Tennessee.
Iwould like to express my appreciation to you and the Foundation for the
current appropriation for advextising theprogram and nominating the
candidates. Part of this money was spent for the fellowship dinner which
was greatly appreciated this fall.
