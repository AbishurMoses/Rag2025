Dear Mr. Sowers:
Thank you for your letter of March 5. I talked with Jerry
Albritton a few days ago and he is looking for work in Florida.
He also stated that he may be going to school next year to work
on his master's degree.
Luane Logan plans to teach at Madison next year, and I am not sure
what Elaine Anderson plans to do. She finished her work the first
semester and is home now. If you would like to write to her
personally, her address is Route 5, Hendersonville, North Carolina.
Ialso talked with Barbara Botts this morning regarding dean's work
along with teaching gixl's physical education. She stated that she
did not feel adequately prepared to dal the job. I don' 't believe she
is interested in dean's work at all.
I am sorry we could not be more helpful to you in finding the proper
personnel for your staff next year. M you should have further
questions on any of our graduates, please feel free to write to me
again.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
