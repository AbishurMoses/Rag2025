Dear Doctor Cassell: :
In going over Dr. Leffler's letter again, let me quote
you one paragraph so you can sce exactly what he wrote me :
"It seems to me that it would be impossible for you to
qualify in half of the summer session for nine term hours and
also take your comprehensives. In the first place, you would
not be permitted to register for nine quarter hours. This
is almos st a full summer's load for the ten weeks of the
summe: r session."
On this pr emise I based my as sumption that it would be
impossible for me to make it. I had told him I could be bhere
two weeks earlier to do special reading. If they would just
accept the three-hour course in science I took in '59, it could
be done. You have inspired me to want to finish now sO I wi sh
S omething could be worked out.
I am enclo sing a copy of the letter I wrote to Dr. Leffler
today.
Most sincerely,
hcta
