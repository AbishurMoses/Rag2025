Dear Hube rt:
The last night of the Bible Conference I was able to locate
one additional copy of the outline coverning my presentation.
I latched hold of this copy with the thought of sending it to
you after returning to the campus.
It was certainly a privilege and inspiration to attend this
Bible Conference and it is our sincere hope that the
inspiration gained there will not be lost. Our students are
already beginning to work on the idea of promoting several
events and programs on this campus to bring the blessing
home.
Before this letter reaches you, we will see each other
again in Miami. I did want to get this thing in the mail
for you before losing this last copy.
Cordially yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
