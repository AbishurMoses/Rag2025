Lagrange College
Lagrange, Georgia
Dear Doctor Harwell:
Thanks so much for your kind letter of March 23. It is
always a pleasure to enlarge one's cirele of friends and
it was a distinct pleasure to get acquainted with
and
the other members of the visiting committee. We certainly you
appreciated the time that you and each member gave to this
school in reviewing its activities. One's home work never
ceases while he is gone and I know that you had much to do
after you returned to your school.
We sincerely appreciated the suggestions given us and shall
implement then as fast as possible. In fact, it wi1l be a
pleasure to strengthen our position in such areas where
weaknesses were detected.
Thani you again for your kindness and it will be a
to see you again at some of the conferences and
pleasure
scheduled in the future.

Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider

Dr. Wilbert M. Schneider, Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Schneider:
I want to thank you for the hospitality shown to me and to
members' of the Southern Association visiting committee during
our recent visit to Southern Missionary College. Despite
the fact that much work had to be performed by members of the
committee, you and members of your faculty made our stay
both profitable and enjoyable.
I am this day completing my portion of the self-study report
and shall send it to Dr. Christenberry. I hope that you
realize from my preliminary report which was given on
Wednesday, that the committee was pleased with conditions
we found at Southern Missionary College. There were a few
minor conditions which needed to be called to your attention
which in most cases were already identified by you. Never-
thel√®ss, these, we felt, should be included in the report.
I hope that our paths will cross again and certainly I shall
look forward to seeing you at meetings of college deans from
time to time.
Sincerely yours,
Tn
