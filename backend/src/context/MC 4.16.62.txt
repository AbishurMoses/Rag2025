Dear Dr. Schneider:
Thank you very much for your letter of the 12th
regarding our request to you concerning the acceptance of
our credits.
I belie ve that the statement that you have made will
be satisfactory. I am enclosing a copy, however, of the
statement that we have received from the University of
Tennessee. Perhaps that will give you some idea as to
what we would like.
We appreciate your consideration of this matter very
much.
If I can be of assistance in any way, please do not
hesitate to let me know.
Sincerely yours,
omk Ahynt
Homer R. Lynd
