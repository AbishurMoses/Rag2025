Mr. Arnold Otto
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Otto:
At a recent meeting of the Administrative House Committee, we
discussed your interest in continuing your graduate work toward a
doctoral degree.
A decision obligating the college to grant financial assistance is a
complex one due to your age and to our need of your teaching services
at the college level during the summer session. We recognize, however,
the important contribution you are making to the elementary school
program on our campus and would not want to stymie any interest you
might have in further graduate work.
Consequently, the House Committee voted to refer this request to
the Board of Trustees at its next meeting. If you should have any
more thoughts on the matter between now and the Board Meeting in
February, please feel free to share them with me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
