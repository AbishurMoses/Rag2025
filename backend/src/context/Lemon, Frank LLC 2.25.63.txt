Dear Dean Schneider:
I am writing to you in the interest of locating Seventh- -day Adventist students
with a mathematical and/or biological background who would be interested in
advanced training for a career in the field of biostatistics. We currently
have a section devoted to thi S interest under Dr. Robert Woods. Jan Kuzma,
a graduate of Emmanuel Missionary College, is completing training in this
field Ã t the University of Michigan, and will eventually be in charge of re =
cruitment and development of this activity.
We envisage an eventual three or four -man staff in this and related areas hav-
ing to do with data processing. Mr. Kuzma has had experience in obtaining
grant support for this training and can give advice concerning schools, fields
of special interest, etc.
It is our expectation that such individuals will join him in this activity at
various intervals during the next four to six years. Biostatistics is expanding
rapidly. Professional people are in very short supply and will be for many
years to come, not only in medical a d public health areas, but in related
fields. We expect to see considerable expansion in both research and teach -
ing at Loma Linda within this area.
I would appreciate it very much if you could send me the names and addresses
of any good prospects whom you think we should contact, or feel free to have
them write to us. Inquiries may be directed either to me or to Jan Kuzma at
1513 S. University, Ann Arbor, Michigan.
Thank you for your assistance in this regard.
Sincerely yours,
) a
Frank R. Lemon, M.D.
