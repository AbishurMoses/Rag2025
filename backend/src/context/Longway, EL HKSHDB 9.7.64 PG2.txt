Dear Brother Rees;
It is my pleasure to write this letter of character re-
ference for our brother, James Tsai Shu-teh. James has been a member of the
Seventh-day Adventist church for twelve years, which means that he was
among the first to join the church after the opening of the work on this
Island.
Two years ago he completed the business traingag√© course at the Taiwan
Missionary College, and since then has been emlpoyed at the Taiwan Sanitar-
ium.
During the time that he was in school he has taken part in the summer
student colporteur activities, always with good success.
The South China Island Union Mission has approved Brother Tsai's plan
for advanded study in the States. I hope that it will be possible for Nrother
Tsai to have this privilege, and that you will kindly do all in your power
to assit him.
Sincerely your brother,
