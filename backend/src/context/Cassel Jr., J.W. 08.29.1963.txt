Dear Doctor Cassell:
I believe your letter addressed to me came during one of my absences, and was refer-
red to George Jr. He asked Dr. Vernon Shafer to make suggestions, and the inquiry
has now found its way back to me.
In spite of the fact that we have these mental health institutes, we have not ac-
cumulated or mimeographed materials of the type which you suggest for a faculty
colloquium. It was Dr.Shafer's opinion, having worked with Miss Florence Culpan,
that she would have a better selection of material such as you would require for
your purposes than we have in our library. We do have a file of the Science
Research Association's mental health literature, and the material put out by the
National Mental Health Association which of course are available on request, at a
Small expense. It would be necessary to make a selection, and I believe Miss Culpan
would be of invaluab le assistance to you in doing this.
We hope that it will be possible for you to attend the next Mental Health Institute
in October,1964.
Sincerely yours,
dakdue
George T. Harding Sr., M.D.
