Cedar Lake, Michigan
Dear Mr. Jensen:
There is no one that I could recommend to you as a qualified piano and
organ teacher. Unfortunately we just lost our own argan instructor at
the last minute and are looking for such a person ouxselves.
I have heard that there is a Roslyn Maben teaching in Fresno, California
at the elementary level who is quite an accomplished organist. I believe
ahe has had some graduate work in music at Andrews. She would not
meet our requirements, however, since she does not have her Master's
degree.
I know of none of our graduates here who are available for placement
at the present time. M some name should come to my attention, I would
be more than glad to share the information with you.
Best wishes to you.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
