Dear Dr. Shankel
A few days have elapsed since I received. your letter, but with the
pressure of our board meeting and other items, I have had to delay
my answer. I wish I knew someone. I might recommend to you to head
up your business and economics department, but I do not know of any-
one as far along in his doctoral work as what you would need.
Perhaps, you saw the letter from Elder Cossentine recommending the
name of J. Russell Nelson who received his Ph. D at the University
of California. It is possible he might be interested in something
like this, and in view of that I am enclosing the letter written
by Elder Cossentine.
Dr. Stokes has returned to our campus now, and at my very next
opportunity I will ask him if he has anyone to recommend for the
job. In such case,. I am sure he would be glad to write you his
recommendations. With kindest regards, I am
Very, sincerely yours
