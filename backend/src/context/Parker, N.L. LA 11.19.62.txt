Lynwood, California
Dear Brother Parker:
Since last April I have had your letter written to W. H. Taylor
on my desk and have given consideration to it several times.
We, too, are very much interested in the training of librarians
that will be able to service our academy libraries as well as
teach a class or two. Of course you have a good sized academy
which represents much responsibility in matters of operating a
library.
We would like to suggest to you the names of Jeraldine Owen
and Rogene Goodge. Jeraldine Owen is graduating with a major
in elementary education but has taken our library classes and
worked. in the library for several years. She is a very fine
lady with a Christian devotion that you would appreciate very
much. Rogene Goodge is a rather large lady who is graduating
with a major in secondary education and a minor in English.
She desires to teach English on the secondary level and as her
second choice to do library work, Of course both of these could
go together. Jeraldine Owen states that her preference would be
elementary school teaching with her second choice being that of
a children's librarian. She has been a telephone operator and has
done some hospital work. Her minor is religion.
If you have an interest in any of these young ladies, please let
me know and I shall speak to them and perhaps they can write
you. In the meantime we will do everything possible to train
librarians.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
