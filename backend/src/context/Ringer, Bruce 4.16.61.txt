Mr. Bruce Ringer
Collegedale
Tennessee
Dear Mr. Ringer:
Inasmch as we are endeavoring to promote uniform attire
for recreational purposes, wwe hope that the College Mercantile
wi1l stock black clam diggers for the young ladies in sufficient
sizes to permit sbopping on our campus- Next fall we hope that
the stock will be available so that we will be able to require
this attice from the very outset.
It seens that the clan digger is working out very
satisfactorily for the young Jadies, but there is some thought
that the recreatienal attire for the young men in the form of
the white duck deckexs leaves somet thing to be desired. Mr.
Cooper repor ts that during hard wear, they have a tendency
to split. Because of this, it may be weil for us to xeconsider
the apparel for the young men, but insofar as the
ladies
are concerned, I think we have something that Jooks young good and
wears well.
ME you bave any question in regsrd to this matter, you
will, of course, wish to consult with Mr. Fleming.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
