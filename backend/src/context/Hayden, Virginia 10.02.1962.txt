Dear Dean Schneider:
Your nomination of Mr. Clarence Chinn for a Danforth Teacher Grant
has been received.
I am sorry to have to tell you that Mr. Chinn is not eligible for
the Danforth Teacher Grant Program, since this program is designed
exclusively for pre-doctoral study. The Advisory Council for this
program has decided that teachers holding a Ph.D. in one field will
not be eligible even though they may wish to complete a Ph.D. in
another field.
I an enclosing an additional nomination form should you wish to
nominate another teacher from Southern Missionary College.
Sincerely,
Binginia -
