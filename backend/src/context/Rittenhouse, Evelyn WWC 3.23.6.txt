Miss Evelyn Rittenhouse
Walla Walla College
College Place, Washington
Dear Miss Rittenhouse:
I appreciate your kind letter of March 16. Although I was sorry to
hear that you would not be joining us here at Southern Missionary
College. I understand your feeling, however, and I certainly admire
your loyalty to Walla Walla. Ihope that we may have the opportunity
to work together at some future time. We hear very excellent reports
of your work and we know that you are making a fine contribution to
the program at Walla Walla.
I trust the Lord will richly bless you as you continue to serve Him
there.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
