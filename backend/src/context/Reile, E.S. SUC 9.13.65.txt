Dear Jack:
Our Southern Union Bible Conference will be held October 13-16, at which
time, we will have our representatives from each of the academies, as well
as SMC and Oakwood. Dr. Rees will be with us and it would be nice if you
could find time to join us to be there during that time to get acquanted
with the young people and to fellowship with them.
I have visited with Dr. Rees and he has mentioned that I might write to
you to see if you could come. We would like to invite you and trust
that you can work it into your busy schedule for all or part of the time.
Let us know when you can be there and we will try to make reservations for
you at the motel. I hope that you will be able to join us.
Best wishes.
Sincerely yours,
Barser tr
