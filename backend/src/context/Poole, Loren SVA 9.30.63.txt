Mr. Loren Poole, Principal
Shenandoah Valley Academy
New Market, Virginia
Dear Loren:
Doctor Rees and I will be leaving Collegedale Tuesday morning to
attend the American Council on Bducation meetings in Washington,
D.C.
Sometime Wednesday morning we will be through New Market and
would like to visit the academy briefly. As you probably know,
Doctor Rees was formerly dean of boys at S.V.A.
We will look forward to seeing you at that time.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
