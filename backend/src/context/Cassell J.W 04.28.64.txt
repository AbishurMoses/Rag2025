Dear Mr. Simpson:
Last month when my electric bill was due, I was out of town until
the Friday before the deadline of March 29. Since I had not had
the opportunity to pay the bill prior until March 29, I paid it on that
day and mailed it on March 30 feeling that I would still be charged
only the net rate since it was impossible for me to have had the letter
postmarked on the 29th. However, on this month's statement, I notice
that I have been charged the additional $5 gross rate and I would Mke
to request that consideration be given to crediting me with this amount
due to the problem stated above.
I would certainly appreciate any consideration you could give me in
this matter.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
