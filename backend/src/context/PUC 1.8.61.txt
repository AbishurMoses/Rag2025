Dr. M. E. Mathisen, Dean
Pacific Union College
Angwin, California
Dear Doctor Mathisen:
From time to time students who have been in the Armed
Services abroad and have availed themselves of educational
opportunities offered by Maryland University or through
USAFI program are anxious that we accept the credits thus
earned in order to give them advanced standing on the. college
level.
We here at Southern Missionary College are inclined to
accept the credits presented through Maryland University,
inasmuch as the program offered by the University is very
effective. We are anxious to know, howe ver, what the practice
is among the colleges in regard to the acceptance of credits
earned by way of the college level GED test.
Would you be so kind as to write me of your experience
and what you do in regard to the credits thus presented.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
