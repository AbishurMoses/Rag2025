Miami, Florida
Dear Mrs. Maxon:
We appreciate your interest in coming to Southern Missionary
College at this time to pursue a program of summer studies.
We would like very nuch to have you here but it is considerably
too late to begin courses of study now being taught. Education
to be worth anything must be provocative and even though it is
possible for students to skim over certain assigned materials,
it is hardly feasible to pursue such a program, The student
should allow his thoughts to penetrate in order for subject
matter to be of any value.
We have a few courses beginning July 9 such as Revelation,
Physiology and then it would be possible for students to take
the last half of some courses that run for eight weeks. A11
of our courses in the field of education run for six weeks
only because of the General Conference Session.
We wish that we could be of service to you but it is not
educationally sound practice to permit students to begin
class woris at such a late date. We hope we can be of help
to you in the future.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
