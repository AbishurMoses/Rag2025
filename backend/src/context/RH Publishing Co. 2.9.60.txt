Dear Brethren:
It seems that the two books "Captains of the Host" and
Christ's Last Legion" are out of print. We have secured
a few extra copies from some of the Book and Bible
Houses, but so far not enough. I wonder if you would
know where we could secure additional copies in
North America.
I should 1ike to ask you If there is inapreparation
any book which would be suitable for the college
leve1. Naturally, if Such a book was in prospect
we would not attempt to stack up on these books.
Any infozmat tion you can give on these two points
would be appreciated.
Sincerely. yours,
G. E, Shankel
