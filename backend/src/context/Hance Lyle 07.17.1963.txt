Dear Doctor Hance:
I wish to take this opportunity to express appreciation for your
kindness in conducting the mathematics workshop on our campus
recently. Doctor Kennedy informs me that the workshop was
highly successful land that the students participating greatly
appreciated your contribution.
We look forward to the opportunity of having you on our campus
frequently in the future.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
