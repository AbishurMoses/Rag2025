TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
This is to signify that Mr. Jesse Jones took part in a History Tour
of the New England States sponsored by Southern Missionary College.
Although Mr. Jones did not take the course for credit, he took an
active part in the tour and met all other requirements. Students
taking the tour for credit received two hours of lower biennium credit.
Any consideration that could be given to Mr. Jones would be greatly
appreciated.
Sincerely yours,.
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
