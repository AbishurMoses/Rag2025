Dear Doctor Harding:
We were pleased with the arrangement afforded by your
institution inr permitting the teaching of a course in
psychiatric nursing to nurses interested in such a review.
Miss Cuipan, the instructor, was very enthusiastic and
remains so at this time. We appreciate the cordial atmosphere
that prevailed and we are rather interested in a further develop-
ment of this program.
We would appreciate a frank apprasial on your part and a
statement regarding its future at your institution. Please
be frank in your evaluation of the program and of course we
would not wish to burden you with such a program in the future
if you considered it inadvisable to continue.
Thanks again for the possibilities afforded. Perhaps It woald
be possible to cover such an operation with a grant from the
government. There are those who feel that this may be forth-
coming. Your apprasial of the program wiil be very much appreciated.
Very sincerely yours,
Wibert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
