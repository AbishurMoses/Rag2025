Mr. C. L. Jaqua, Principal
Bass Memorial Academy
Box 191
Lumberton, Mississippi
Dear Brother Jaqua:
First of all, I wish to thank you sincerely for the pleasant
week end we had on your campus. Certainly things are going
well at Bass and we appreciated the fine spirit on your campus
among thestudent group and of course the great hospitality
shown us by your staff. We enjoyed so much the lovely meal
we had with you and the afternoon in meeting Mr. Bass and his
property. Please give Miss Moon our sincere thanks for her
kindness in putting us up for the night. The facilities were most
pleasant in every way.
While visiting with you, mention was made of your forthcoming
needs in the food service area. You mentioned the name of
Mrs. Black. I have conferred with Mrs. Dorothy Christensen,
head of our Home Economics Department, and she has led me
to believe that Mrs. Black is interested in a year's work in
connection with some hospital for the purpose of securing her
American Dietetics Association membership. After that she
would be very much interested in becoming a food service
director in one of our schools. Mrs. Christensen suggested
the name of Judi Henderson. Judi has a quiet dignity about her
and Mrs. Christensen felt that Judi could give you excellent
service in every way, including the maintenance of order in the
dining room. Perhaps you will wish to write to Mrs. Christensen
to get a first-hand account of her evaluation. We hope that this
suggestion will be of value to you. Judi will be graduating in the
spring and with her slightly graying hair, she appears to be quite
mature.
Come see us whenever the opportunity arises.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
