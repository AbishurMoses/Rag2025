Garden Grove, California
Dear Mr. Park:
We were pleased to receive your telephone call of last week
indicating an interest in Miss Sandra E1liott and Miss Annetta
Owens as prospective teachers in your school: It is always a
pleasure to work with our seniors in securing placement in our
various schools.
Sandra Elliott is a capable young lady and should do a good job
teaching English. Her sister, I believe, is presently teaching
at the Glendale Academy. I had a chance to visit with Sandra
Thursday afternoon and she expresses a genuine interest in joining
your staff if you shoutdinvite: hez to your school.
You also mentioned a need in the Home Economics field. I suggested
the name of Annetta Ouens. Annetta is very enthusiastic about the
possibility of joining your staff especially since she is acquainted
with you and think so much of you. She seens to be doing a good job
in her student teaching but as I indicated on the phone, Annetta is
not equipped to handle Physical Education or anything in the
secretarial field. It may be that she could pick up some Physical
Education at the University of Arkansas this summer to eguip her
in this area to the extent that she could be of service to you.
This I belfeve she would be willing to do.
It may be that you will wish to write to Mrs. Dorothy Christensen,
head of the Home Economics Department, to secure first-hand infor-
mation regarding Annetta Owens and perhaps to Miss Eviyn-Lindberg
or Dz. Clyde Bushne 11 in regard to Sandra Elliott. Both of these
individuals are well acquainted with Sandra.
Let us hear from you again and we shall endeavor to assist you
in your personnel problems.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
