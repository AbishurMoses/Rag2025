Dear Kendall:
For some reason or other the Michigan Bell Telephone Company sent
the last statement to me. Of course.this should have gone to the
university since this is paid by them. The following calls are personal
and should be charged to my account.
The two calls to South Bend at the CE 3-3154 mumber totaling $.80.
The two Sister Lakes, Michigan calls at 424-3304 totaling $.85.
The other calls were made on school business and should be paid by
the university. I hope this will not cause you a problem in billing.
Iappreciate your sending my final check to me here at Southern
Missionary College.
Already we have fallen in love with this beautiful spot and feel that
we will enjoy our service here. If you are ever down this way, please
be sure to stop by. I have always appreciated your patience in answering
some of my questions concerning charges over the past years. I feel
confident that you will contime to make an excellent contribution to the
program at Andrews.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
