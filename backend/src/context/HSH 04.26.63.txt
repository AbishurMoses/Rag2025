Dear Doctor Schneider:
Please accept this letter as my personal appre-
ciation for the very kind and hospitable treatment
I received while I was a guest at your institution
on my trip south. It was a pleasure to spend a
couple of days there in the Chattanooga area and
to have met with some of our people who are looking
for employment at Hinsdale Sanitarium and Hospital.
Under separate cover I am sending you a book to
express to you our appreciation for what you have
done for us and also to explain a little about the
work at the Hinsdale Sanitarium and Hospital.
With kindest best wishes and personal Christian
regards, I am
Very sincerely yours,
) -
