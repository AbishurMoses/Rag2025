Dear Dr. Shankel
Dean Clark of the College of Medical Evange-
lists suggested to write and inform you about the
Janzen Trailer Park that is conveniently located
about one mile from the school. It offers medical,
dental, and therapy students a 10% discount on the
flat rates which are $26.00 and $24.00 a month for
the space (including water and garbage.)
Perhaps you would be kind enough to anounce
this offer to the students 80 that whoever is
planning to go to school here and live in a trailer
could get in touch with us and make necessary
arrangements for the new school year.
Enclosed you will find a card with further
details which could be put on the bulletin board.
This will be very much appreciated.
Truly yours,
