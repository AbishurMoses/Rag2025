Dear Mrs. Henry:
This is just a little letter of appreciation on
behalf of our group who spent a very pleasant
and especially to thank you for your own personal day,
time which you 50 generously gave. It was a very
pleasant and profitable day for a1l of us.
As a very small expression of appreciation, I am
sending you a year's subscription to "These Times"
in which I think you will find some material that
may be of interest to you since it is devoted to
issues facing our world today. I hope you may
find something in it of interest to you.
Very kind regards and again thanking you for a
very pleasant occasion, I am
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
