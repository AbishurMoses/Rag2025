Plainfieid, Nesr Jersey
Dear Mr. Poole:
We are sorry that we have no one to suggest as an English and
French teacher for your school. The teaching of French in this
school has not been too strong, but instead we have been giving
most of our instruction in Spanish and German. It may be that
Emmanuel Missionary College would have someone to suggest.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
