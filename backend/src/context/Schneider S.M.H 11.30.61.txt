Gentlemen:
Before leaving the Seventh-day Adventist group meeting held
at your hotel earlier this month, I made reservations for
our famiiy effective December 3-6. It was my thought that
we would stay at the Saint Moritz while attending the
Southern Association meeting to be held at the Fountain
Bleau Hotel.
It wi1l not be possible for me to attend this meeting.
Therefore, would you kindly cancel these reservations.
We hope to see you again next fa1l. There will be three
other representatives from our college checking in at the
Saint Moritz the evening of December 3. We appreciate your
kindness and your good service.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schne ider
Academic Dean
