Dear Brother Newkirk:
We appreciate your interest in writing us concerning
staff needs for next year. Wouldn't it be wonderful if your we
could always choose our teaching combinations according
to the needs that arise. At the moment I am unable to
think of anyone with a master's degree available in the
fields mentioned in your letter. I shall continue to give
study to this problem and should there be such an individual
available, I will immediately get in touch with you.
Very sincerely yours,
