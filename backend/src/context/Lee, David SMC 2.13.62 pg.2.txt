Dear Wilbert:
I just came in contact with a young man who is head of Purina
Mills in Memphis, Tennessee. He is an outstanding young man, has
a degree from Michigan State University in Agriculture Engineering.
He became a Seventh-day Adventist approximately four years ago. He
is now servi ing as quality-Control Foreman of the two Ralston-Purina
Company mills; one in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the other in Memphis.
He has received word that he is going to be given another promotion.
He is positive this is going to run him into Sabbath difficulties;
therefore, he has contacted me.
He believes that he could make a real contribution to Loma Linda
Foods Company because his background is in food packaging, storage
and dist tribution. His name is David Lee. His address: 1193 Perkins
Terrace, Memphis 17, Tennessee. If you think it the right thing to
do, please write him and give him the name of individuals he could
contact at Loma Linda Foods. I would be very happy to give him a
recommendation, and it might be well for you to state that I had men-
tioned this in your letter to him.
He is an outstanding young man--very capable--and I think we
ought to use him if at all possible.
Very sincerely yours,
Desmond Cummings, Secretary
