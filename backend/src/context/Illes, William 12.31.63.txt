Mr. William Iles
P.0. Box 2307
Orlando, Florida
Dear Bill:
We appreciate your deep interest in Southern Missionary College
and your willingness to provide financial aid to some of our needy
students.
We have several excellent students who are badly in need of
financial assistance. We would be most happy if you could again
favor us with a check to replenish the William Iles Scholarship Fund.
I assure you the scholarship committee will appropriate this money
carefully and fairly. If you have any suggestions in terms of students
that you are personally acquainted with and you would like to see
given some assistance, please feel free to contact us.
Again, let me say how much we deeply appreciate your strong support
of Southern Missionary College. I would like to wish you and your
family a very happy new year,
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
