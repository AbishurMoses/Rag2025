Doctor Wilbert M. Schneider
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Doctor Schneider:
The pressure of school auditing, which confronts us at this
particular time of the year, has led me to neglect some of
my correspondence. Consequently I am a bit late in answer -
ing your letter of July 27 in which you mention Mr. Eugene
Luttrell, who is graduating with a business major, and who
is anxious to secure denominational employment.
I am sorry that I cannot tell you of any specific opening
that might be available for Mr. Luttrell in the Pacific
Union Conference just at this time. To say that we will
place his name in our file and keep him in mind does not
do any particular good at this time, when he needs to know
definitely what could be worked out for him in the immediate
future. However, this seems to be the best we can do at
present, and we will definitely keep him in mind.
We trust you are enjoying your new work at Southern Mission-
ary College, and hope that you will keep us in mind in case
you have other young men who might be of interest to us in
the Pacific Union Conference.
Very sincerely yours,
Werber Johnson
Auditor
