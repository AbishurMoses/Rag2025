Dear Mr. Spring:
In accordance with our telephone conversations last fall, we have been
in the process of studying the matter of the grades given to students
when they are dismissed from Southern Missionary College.
After a careful survey of the practices df other institutions of higher
education, we have come to the conclusion that instead of giving "F's"
in cases where students are dismissed for disciplinary reasons after
the published date in the bulletin, we will now give the student either a
"WP" or a "WR" depending on the quality of his academic work at the
time of dismissal. This seems to be the most common and accepted
practice among most colleges in this part df the United States.
We also voted to apply this policy retroactively one year. Consequently,
I am enclosing another copy of Harry's transcripts with the corrected
grades. Itrust this will enable him to continue his college work without
the extreme penalty of the "F" grades previously recorded on his trans-
cript. It is out feeling that a student should not be punished academically
for his social misconduct. Of course it is impossible for him to com-
pletely escape some academic pumishment since he does lose his credits
for the semester in which he came under disciplinary action, but at least
he is not forever penalized by failing grades. In cases where he receives
"WP's"1 his grade point average will not be affected in any way. Of course
"WF's" might affect his grade point average, all depending on the policy
of the institution to which he transfers.
I trust this action by Southern Missionazy College will be of some
assistance to Harry as he continues his education.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
