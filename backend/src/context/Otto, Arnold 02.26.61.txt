is very happy about it.
Inasmuch as you will be with the program during the
summei r months, we are anxious tha t you assist the education
department in teaching the classes ne cessary for the elementary
school teachers who will be coming in for our summer school
program. As matters stand now, we would appreciate your

2 hours; Mental Hygiene, 3 hours; and Wor 1d Geography, 3 hours.
Although we have assigned periods of the day when these classes

assignmer nt s until several days from now.
Thank you again for giving us assistance during the
summer program, and, of course, most of all staying by the
