Dear Ina:
I am pleased to inform you that the House Committee voted to grant
your request for reimbursement of the funds expended by the club
for the reception that was canceled as a result of President Kennedy's
death. The Sigma Theta Chi account will be immedlately credited with
$235.59.
Again, let me say how much we appreciated the good spirit of the giris
in cancelling this very important social affair at the last minute. We
trust this appropriation will enable the club to function successfully for
the remainder of the school year. .
Should you have any further question, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean

Dear Council:
A matter of concern with the women of Sigma Theta Chi, is the
great lack of funds due to the cancelation of the reception
the first semester. It s our understanding that at that time
the faculty stated that it would help us with our losses. We
would be grateful for your consideration of the enclosed list
of expenditures and the Sigma Theta Chi financial situation.
As a club this second semester, we have been limited in our
activities because of the yoke placed upon us by this loss.
I feel as president of the club, I too, cannot fulfill to the
possible extent the position into which I have been placed.
The other officers and I are at a standstill, in that it is
impossible to plan any activity which requires the slightest
amount of money.
I am writing for the benefit of the women of the club and will
be grateful for your closest consideration of this matter.
Thanking you for your cooperation, I am
Sincerely yours,
