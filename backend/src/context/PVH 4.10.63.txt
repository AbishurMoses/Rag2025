Dear Miss Noble:
I have had no reply from Mr. Robert B. Dickinson in regard to an
interest in joining your staff as a Physical Therapist. Several
other offers have been made and perhaps he has more interest in
some situations that have developed locally. Sorry we are unable
to assist you at this time.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
