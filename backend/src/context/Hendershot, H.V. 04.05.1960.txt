Collegedale,
Tennessee
Dear Bider Hendershot:
In connection with the Baccalaureate Service on
May 21, I wonder if you would be so kind as to
offer the benediction. Elder Kenneth Wood is
to give the address.
We would appreciate it very much if you will
accept this responsibility.
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
AÃ§ademic Dean
