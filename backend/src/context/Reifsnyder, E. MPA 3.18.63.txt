Dear Brother Reifsnyder:
The National Teachers Examination will be scheduled for July 21
and af course this fact will be more widely publicized later on.
We will be happy to have your teachers take the examination on
our campus and any others who will be seniors or who will have
graduated from college. From time to time we get requests from
elementary teachers in the field that may have taken as much as
two years of college work. These people are not prepared to take
the examination. The examination is geared to graduates.
At present I am working on the summer bulletin and chis should be
available in two or three weeks.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilberz M. Schneider
Academic Dean
