Dear Mr. De Ark:
Mr. Don West spoke to me of your need pertaining to instructors
in the field of Industrial Arts. We have also received an
invitation from the Chattanooga School Systen to place three
Industrial Arts teachers in various schools" in the area. We
only wish that more were available.
May I suggest that you correspond with Mr. Joe Galusha,
Bmmanue 1 Nissionary College, Berrien Springs, Michigan.
Joe is a member of the Industrial Arts staff at that school
and I believe they have a pretty good program. It may be
that he would Iow of indi viduals available in this area.
Ne wish you success as you endeavor to staff your needs.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
