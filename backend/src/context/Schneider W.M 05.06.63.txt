Your letter awaited our return from Camp Cumby Gayas The senioriw bolasoso
class took their week end outing in the mountains of Carolina whereduib eal lo
the beauty istunsurpassed any where. The Georgla-Cumberland wasT oris e R
Conference has a camp there and we have had the privilege of going
there five times sincewe have been here. It is a beautiful site. In
fact, I am always impressed with the fact that I have been in no state
more beautiful than North Carolina.
After reading your letter, we feel likel suitors who have been spurned.
We had hoped that you would decide to come but I can personally under-
stand your problem. If all things settle down, there may still be a
chance in the future. We can understand that it is difficult for you to
uproot yourself for employment all the way across the continent. We
do not know what the future has in store for us but we shall be perfectly
satisfied to remain here awhile longer. Obviously we are westernini a
spirit but hav√®ienjoyed our stay here as much as any where we have been.
We are perfectly content to follow the leadings of our Master. Many
changes are taking place at this time but we hope that they will not
effect our school here. I was interested to learn that Elder Huebach
is going to be at Loma Linda. He will certainly be an asset on that
campus. Also we believe that Rittenhouse will be going to Pacific
Union College. He would have preferred to remain at Berrien Springs
but the brethren apparently felt that a change would be good for the
school there. Iwouldn't be surprised to see Mr. Cleveland from AUC
go to Berrien Springs as Doctor Hammill's assistant.
We have heard reports that the students at Walla Walla College are
giving the administration great concern. It seems that the evil spirit
is hard at work and the job of keeping students placated is becoming
more impossible year by year. We heard yesterday that Percy Christian

was being interviewed by the new Kettering Hospital in Ohto for the
job as public relations man. This he could do most successfully,
We would be most happy if you could join us in the Jackson Hole
country this summer for the few days from about August 12-18.
Tell Elma to get on her western boots and bring Craig along with all
the rest of you for a good time in that area. We could spend a day or
so in Yellowstone also.
The weather has been beautiful this spring and the countryside is2 vaisa aaiM
