Mr. Ted R. Owens, Supervisor
State of Georgia
Department of Education
Division of Instruction
Teacher Certification
State Office Building
Atlanta 3, Georgia 30303
Dear Mr. Owens:
Mr. Ralph M. Hendershott, a graduate of Southern Missionary
College, recently applied to your office for certification as a teacher
in the state of Georgia. Mr. Hendershott felt that he had submitted
the proper form with transcripts for certification. He informs, me,
however, that these papers were returned to him with the statement
that it was assumed that he did not wish to obtain a Georgia teaching
certificate at this time.
Mr. Hendershott is somewhat confused about this since he felt that he
had submitted all the information necessary to qualify for consideration
for a Georgia teaching certificate. He is an excellent student and
graduated from our college in good and regular standing. He is presently
working toward the master's degree at the University of Chattanooga.
Icertainly can very highly recommend Mr. Hendershott and believe that
he will make a valuable contribution to the education program of your
state.
I trust the problem can be satisfactorily corrected so that
Mr. Hendershott's application can be completed. If you should have
any further question, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
