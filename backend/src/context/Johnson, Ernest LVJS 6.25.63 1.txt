Dear Mr. Johnson:
While Dean of Students at Andrews University I had considerable
contact with Miss Nancy Lee Meriweather.
As you probably know, Nancy is an exceptionally capable student
scholastically. She has a nice personality, quite outgoing and friendly.
We did have a very serious problem with Nancy, however, in regard
to stealing. I believe Nancy comes from a socially and economically
deprived home. Consequently the temptation to take things that belonged
toother people was more than she could resist at times. Both the dean
of women and I tried to work with her on num er ous occasions. Although
I feel she made considerable progress, I do not believe that Nancy is
entirely free of this problem. I do not think this would effect her
competency as a teacher but it might be a definite administrative
problem.or a community problem.
Nancy did extremely well in her student teaching and was well liked
by the students. If she can get some professional help with this, I
believe she can make an excellent contribution to the fleld of education.
IfI may be of further assistance to you, please feel free to contact
me .
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
