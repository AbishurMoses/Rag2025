Dear Mr. Howlett:
Thank you for your letter of May 17. I only regret that we do

most of our graduates have been placed already and especially
those who are qualified to teach.
Iam sorry you did not receive one of our senior placement
bulletins. T am sending one to you today.
May the Lord bless you as you endeavor to staff your institutions.
Very sincerely youre,

Dear Sir:
Sandia View Academy is in dire need of a Dean
of Girls to take care of about 45 girls in our
dormitory with possible teaching responsibilities of
Home Economics or help in our library. We also need
a Food Service Director to take full charge of our
cafeteria, working with an assistant who takes the
afternoon shift. We feed about 100 students per meal.
I will sincerely appreciate any help which you
may be able to give to us. There might be a possibility
of using a husband in our large furniture factory.
May I hear from you if you have any suggestions.
Sincerely yours,
*
