Dear Jack:
Even though it did not work out that I would be a member of the staff
at Southern Missionary College, I did want you to know that I appreciated
your interest in me and your desires as you and Brother Rees expressed
on several occasions.
I know the Lord directs in His work and I pray that you will have a good
school year this coming year.
Ib was a real pleasure to have you on our campus and to talk with you and
I shall look forward to our occasional visits together.
Sincerely yours in Christ,
Lo a
