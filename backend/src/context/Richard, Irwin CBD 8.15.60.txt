Gentlenen:
Recently I wrote you in regard to the adoption of
your textbook, Money and Banking, by Charles Prather. This
book will be used beginning September 5 during the senester
term, I inquired whether it would not be pnssible for you
to send me, as instructor, a desk cOpy with the supplementary
test materiais, etc.
As a resuit of ny letter you sent me Dr. Prather's book
entitled, Financing Business Firns. I apprecinte this,
inasnuch as I will be teaching Che Business Finance class
the second senester and it is possible that we will be using
Prather's cextbook, yet, we haven't definitely determined
what book: will be used. In the meantine, I will appreciate
the receipt of the textbook, Noney and Banking by Charles
Prather, with supplenentary naterials.
Thank you.
Very sincerely yours,
