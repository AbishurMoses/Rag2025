Dear Friends:
I appreciate so much your recent letter in which you spoke
of Vernon Wagner and his difficulties. Vernon wrote to me
while on his way to Florida where he has a job this summer
assisting in the Youth Camp. You can very well imagine that
Vernon felt terrible. He felt that he had let a1l of us
down, but of course no one can predict such ai allergy to
wheat dust. I am sorry that it was not possible for him to
stay with you. You would have appreciated hin as a fine
Christian young man.
We have a good Theology Department here at the college, and
within a year we hope to strengthen it even more. We will
gladly send Ralph Cross some S. M. C. raterial at his mother's
address in Okeene, Oklahoma.
We plan to be in Oklahoma sometime in August, and at that
time I wi1l be pleased to have a chance to visit with you in
regard to Ralph and perhaps others.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
