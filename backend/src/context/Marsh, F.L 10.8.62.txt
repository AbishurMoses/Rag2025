Dear Frank:
Your paper entitled, "How O1d Is Our Barth" was very murh
appreciated. After reading it carefully, I found myse! 1f
clearly in your camp:if I had the answers to a thousand
other questions that have come to mind through the years,
then I could be more justified in accepting the view points
of some of the other men, but inasmuch as my finite thinking
cannot encompass nor comprehend even the most minute aspect
of creation, far be it from me to interpret as absolute the
findings of men. It seems that we are not willing to accept
as absolute the zecard which the creator has le.ft for us. If
this is an impossibility of the mind, then I fear that we are
accepting the god of deceit. It seems fantastic that we should
quibble with the mind that conceived us às ahcreatéd being in
the beginning of time. There are many far less complicated
questions which we cannot answer. If we could, we could
establish ourselves as God. Since this is impossible, we seem
to be willing at times to accept the god of deceit.
The program is moving along nicely here at Southern Missionary
College. We were happy to have had with us your good wife,
Alice, while she attended the Seventh-day Adventist Dietetic
Conference on this campus. We were also glad to see Doctor
Rittenhouse over the past weekend during our Alumni Homecoming.
Thes re is a possibility that he and his family may drive down
this way during Thanksgiving vacation.
Thanks again for remembering me with your paper and should any
others be written, I should be very happy to receive them.
Cordially your S,
Wilbert M. Schneider
