Dear Doctor Lewis:
I have instructed our Registrar, Mr. Cyril Futcher, to send a new
transcript for Mary Margaret Walker and give her Psychology credit
for the course Counseling and Guidance.
Actually our Psychology courses are listed within the Education
Department and all carry education numbers at the present time.
We are planning, however, to change this in the near future and
place Psychology in a new Behavioral Science Department.
I trust this new transcript will solve Miss Walker's problem. M you
should have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
