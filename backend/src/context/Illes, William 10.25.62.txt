Dear Mr. Iles:
We appreciate 80 much the opportunity of getting personally
acquainted with you this past week. You are certainly welcome
on this campus and we hope it will be possible for you to visit
us more often in the future.
While you were on the campus I acquainted you with several
students who stand in need of additional financial help in order
to complete the school year. I refer to one of the gentlemen
as William J. Kealy. In giving further study to this matter, I
feel that it will take all of the $250 to assist Mr. Kealy this
year. Mr. Kealy has done well in his school work and we are
anxious that he purs sue his program without interruption, Mr.
Kealy is a fine young Christian gentleman and will make an
excellent accountant. If you find it within your thinking to
present us another check in the amount of $250 for worthy
students, we shall endeavor to channel these funds in the
direction of Mr. Kealy.
In budgeting for his school expenses, we have provided $250
from government funds as a loan to help him the second semester.
It will take approximately $250 to help him complete the first
semester. Mr. Kealy is married and has a three-year old
child, He is able to meet his living expenses and pay his rent
on the apartment from earnings which he obtains while working
in the bakery.
If you find it possible to send us a check at this time, we will
very much appreciate your effort in behalf of our students.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
