Dear Sir:
We have jus t looked over your placement brochure of pros) pective
graduat tes of 1964. You have a number listed under element tary education,
but of course we have no way of telling which of these are now placed
or under commi tment through scholarship plans to other conferences.
We do, however, need a lady elementary teacher for next year to
teach grades 4, 5 and 6 in a new, three-teacher school. There is a
very nice, new, modern school building in a count try location which is
well-equipped and with a congenial staff.
Do you have anyone there who would be available to take a posi-
tion like this whom you could recommend? If so, I would certainly appre-
ciate your putting me in touch with them.
Sincerely yours,
Dlogr 2
