Dr. J. W. Cassell, Jr., Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Jack:
We'11 be happy to study the four lectures which are, no doubi t
in transi it, covering the recent series on your campus entitled
"The Authenticity of the Bible." Of course, in my field this
is always very relevant. I hope they ask the right questions.
Anybody can find answers. I appreciate very much your personal
consideration in having them sent to us.
Our recent lecture series was entitled, "A Search For Adventist
Ethics" and was delivered by Doctor Loveless, Pastor of the
Sligo Church. They were very provocative lectures and perhaps
you can obt tain copies of these lectures from him. I think
that we have depleted our supply.
I think that you learned what we have learned, that the lecture
series which is not integrated with evening worships and chapel
programs will not receive the kind of attention that the lectures
deserve. This year we made Sunday evening the initial lecture
and followed through with two chapels on Monday and Tuesday,
including Monday evening worship.
I understand that the Administrator's Meeting will not be con-
vene at Walla Walla this summer but will be conducted at our
Berkshire Camp in New York state. I still do not know whether
Academic Deans will be invited.
Most cordially,
Herbert E. Douglass
Dean of the College
