Dear Mr. Swang:
I have your letter of October 22 addressed to
Dr. Walters. Dr. Walters is no longer present
at this institution. Oonsequently, the letter was
handed over to the dean for reply.
Southern Missionary College does offer a course
in accounting qualifying students to sit for the
Certified Public Accountants Examination. The
work given leads to the degree of bachelor of
science. Mr. W. E. VandeVere is the person to
whom the questionnaire should be sent.
Sincerely yours,

Does your school offer undergraduate work in accounting
