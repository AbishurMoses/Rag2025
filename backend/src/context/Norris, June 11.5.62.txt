Dear Mrs. Norris:
Your letter to Elder Davis was referred to me for further
consideration. I had the privilege of meeting your son, Paul,
at the recent Southern Union Conference Bible Institute con-
ducted at Camp Kulaqua. This was a wonderful experience for
all of us and I am sure that Paul enjoyed the presentations
immensely.
I had the privilege of also meeting some of the other boys who
are presently attending Brevard Junior College and we hope that
your son's friends will also be able to come to this campus the
second semester. We are very much interested in these fine
young men and shall do all we can to make it possible for them to
attend. I asked Paul to correspond with me in regard to a
Government Loan. A National Defense Student Loan Application
is enclosed which you may complete when Paul is visiting at home,
Our Board is limiting the amount we extend to any one student to
$250 each semester. We understand that Paul has had considerable
experience in supermarket operations. We have a market on our
campus and soon will be moving into a lovely new supermarket.
Perhaps it will be possible for Paul to find employment in this
area. I shall follow through on this and it may be that we can give
him a pretty good job. We feel that Paul will make a fine minister
and shall wo rk with him in moving ahead toward his goal.
There is one matter which I mentioned to Paul and that is that
the college does not extend National Defense loans to freshmen
students until they will have had the opportunity to establish
themselves scholastically and socially on this campus. Since
Paul is presently enrolled on the college level, it may be that
we can secure a progress report from Brevard College to note
