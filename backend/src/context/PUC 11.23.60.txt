Pacific Union College
Angwin, California
Deas Dean Mathisen:
Inasmch as you have had experience from a personal
point of viev with the Danforth Foundai tion program,
pexhaps you can give us some ideas pertaining to their
weekend retreat. We understand that. this is a requixement
and that the Fellows all must attend the services conducted
on Sasurdays.
There is the feeling that the morning leckures
are of a spiritual nature and would not conflict with
our convictions in terms of Sabbath observançe.
In order to advise students properly, we meed
to secure additional information. Yous thoughts
on the subject will be very much appreciated,
Vezy sincereiy youxs,
Wilbert M. Schmeider
Academic Dean
