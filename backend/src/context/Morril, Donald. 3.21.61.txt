Dear Mr. Morrill:
Since you have come to this campus, I have not had the
privilege of getting fully acquainted with you. If at a1l
possible, would you kindly stop in at my office at your
earliest convenience for a brief visit together. I should
like to give you a little news concerning the Lawsons, from
whom you purchased a trailer.
Somet thing very worth while may come out of this
inasmuch as the Lawsons seem to be getting more interested
in the truth of this church.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi Ibert M. Schneider
