Dear Jewell:
Doctor Rees referred your letter of July 18 to me since it involves
an academic problem.
I was happy to learn that your daughter is seriously considering
attending Southern Missionary College. Even though I haveconly been
here a few weeks now, I am thoroughly convinced that this institution
has a lot to offer both spiritually and scholastically.
I get the impression from Miss Rozema' 's letter to you that they would
be very anxious to keep both of the girls at Columbia Union College.
This, of course, is understandable but is a little hard for me to see
why they feel our courses are not comparable to theirs. I am confident
that our pre-mursing program here would very adequately prepare the
girls for either the Florida Sanitarium or Washington. Of course we
no control over their requirements and if they insist that their transfer have
students take additional work prior to entering nurses training,
have
this right. The least complicated thing would be for the girls to they
their work here at Southern Missionary College. If they do decide complete to
here this year, however, and then transfer to Washington, I
come
will have no choice but conform to the program that Miss Rozema imagine they
It probably would mean that the girls would have to spend an extra outlines. summer
in school at Washington.
I think it is rather unfortunate that our sister college is not willing to
accept our course work at face value. I am sure it is just as strong
academically as what they are offering at Washington.
I sincerely hope the girls can work out their program satisfactorily and
can be with us this coming school year. If you should have any further
questions, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. w. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
