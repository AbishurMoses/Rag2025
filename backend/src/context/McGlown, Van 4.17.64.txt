Dear Mr. McGlown:
Since talking with you on the phone recently, I have checked with a
number of our two-year secretarial graduates. However, I believe
most or all of them have been placed already. I just talked with
Molly Vigil on the phone and she tells me that she plans to return to
Mexico which is her home.
I am sorry we cannot be of help to you at this time. However, if we
hear of someone who might be interested in the position you have
open, we will certainly get in touch with you.
If we can help you further, please feel free to contact us.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
