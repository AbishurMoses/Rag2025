Dear Dr. Schneider:
Your letter of January 9 addressed to Elder Eric
Ristau was received this morning. At the present time
he is out of the office attending our annual colporteur
institute and Book and Bible House and Publishing Depart-
ment Surveys. He will not be back in the office until
January 22.
I have sent him a copy of your letter and am
placing your letter on his desk for his attention when
he returns.
I noticed that Mr. Garner's student identification
card, that was attached to his application for the Pub -
lishing Department Career Scholarship, is for the school
year 1959-60. Since he undoubtedly has a new card for
the present school year, I believe it will be all right
to hold it until after Elder Ristau returns. We will
then send it back to you, as you requested.
Sincerely yours,
S  ouane
(Mrs.) Carol S. Palsgrove
Secretary to Eric Ristau
