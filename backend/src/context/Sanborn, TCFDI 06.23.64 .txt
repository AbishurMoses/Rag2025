Dear Mr. Sanborn:
At a recent meeting of the President's Council it was voted to permit
James Roberts and Richard Winters to live in the fire station to help
maintain and man the equipment for the remainderof the summer.
They will be required to move into the dormitory prior to the opening
of school in the fall. I hope these boys will serve well during the
remainder of the summer months.
Sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean

Dear Dean Cassell:
Due to the large number of regular firemen leaving for summer
vacation and the lack of experienced firemen the Fire Department
has been left in a hazardous condition this summer.
The board would appreciate approval granted James Roberts and
Richard Winters to live at the fire station to he.lp maintain
and man the equipment when needed.
These boys have served faithfully and we trust it will be
possible for them to continue with the Fire Department.
Your consideration will be greatly appreciated.
Respectfully yours,
