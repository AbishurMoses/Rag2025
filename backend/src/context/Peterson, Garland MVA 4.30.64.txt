Mr. Garland C. Peterson
Mount Vernon Academy
Mount Vernon, Ohio
Dear Mr. Peterson:
As you probably have heard, Mr. Lyle Hamel has accepted a call to be
principal at Sheyenne River Academy for the coming school year.
Consequently, it will be impossible I am sure for Mr. Hamel to take
part in your music camp to be held this summer in Ohio. The admini-
stration did approve his attendance at this camp and I am very sorry
that a representative from Southern Missionary College cannot be there.
At the present time we are negotiating a call for Mr. William Young
of Adelphian Academy in Holly, Michigan. I doubt, however, that
Mr. Young would be able to attend since he will just be coming to the
campus and would need to get settled prior to the beginning of the
academic year.
We do appreciate your interest and trust that we may have the opportuntty
of participating at some later date.
Sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jx.
Academic Dean
