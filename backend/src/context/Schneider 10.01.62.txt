P. 0. Box 401
Mount Berry, Georgia
Dear Mr. Situmeang:
Your letter to the Director of Admissions was referred to me
for further consideration. We note with interest your desire
to come to Southern Missionary College if financial arrangements
can be worked out to the satisfaction of a1l concerned. I am
sure that you vould appreciate being on a Seventh-day Adventist
college campus. Berry College has operated on a work-study basis
for many years and has done a great deal of good.
Southern Missionary College operates a number of industries in
which our students work. We do not, however, work one semester
and study the next semester. The student gces io school while
he works as many hours as is possible with his college program.
Of course during the summer months the student can work full time
in the college industries and thereby build up financial resources
for the coming school year. It would be very difficuit, however,
for us to provide sufficient work for you to be able to defray
your pes rsonal egpenses.
I am taking your letter to the College Finance Committee and it
may be that further study will provide some answer for) yourproblem.
Perhaps it would be possible for one of us to stop by and visit with
you sometime during this semester when on our way to Florida to
attend some meetings that areloccasionally scheduled in Orlando.
It may be that we can find a sponsor who would be willing to
assume your personal expenses. In any event we sha1l try to work
out a solution to your problem. This may take a little time and,
of course we cannot assure success, but we shall surely try.
We were certainly happy to hear from you and to lonow that you are
not far from us. Ne shall try to see you sometime in the future.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
AÃ§ademic Dean
