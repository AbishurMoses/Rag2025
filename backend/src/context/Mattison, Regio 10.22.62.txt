Apartado 25710
Mexico 12, D. F., Mexico
Dear Mrs. Mattison:
We wish to express sincere appreciation for your efforts in
beha 1f of our Language Fie 1d School students who had the
privilege of studying in Mexico last summer. Your work in
securing necessary housing in Mexico City represented a great
deal of effort. We are, of course, sorry and chagrin over the
incident involving one of our young men and one of the young
ladies from Califoria. We had not expected this but have since
discovered many things. The rest of the students seemed to have
enjoyed their stay a great deal and it is creating a genuine
interest on our campus for studies in foreign languages. We
also hope that this will create a desire on the part of some
of our students to enter the service as missionaries to foreign
countries.
We are not certain concerning plans for next summe r. If
Brother Thoman from Pacific Union College is interested in
another Language Field School, we are hopeful of combining
our efforts with Pacific Union College. If not, we shall move
ahead with our plans to again conduct a summe r fie ld school as
we did year before last.
Please give my regards to your good husband. Some of the rest
of us wish we could also have the privilege of visiting Mexico
along with some of our students.
Very sincerely yours,
Wil 1bert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
