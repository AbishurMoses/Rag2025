Mrs. Leland Straw
Little Creek Academy
Concord, Tennessee
Dear Mrs. Straw:
You will remember, I am sure, the occasion of your visit before
school began regarding Virginia Schuler ande her work. We have
had quite a lot of dealings over this matter, and I thought I
would let you know the outcome 5o that you would be aware of
exactly of what has been done. I believe Virginia had three
units to finish at Little Creek in order to graduate from there.
She took two of these units by correspondence this summe r
which left only one unit, and she is taking that in our
academy-
Naturally, we would not expect to graduate her since she has
taken ondy one unit here, and you could not graduate her since
she has taken her last three units elsewhere. This le aves
her without a high school diploma.
I have had quite extended interviaws with her and her father
telling them that if she runs into difficulty later on over
the fact of not having a high school diploma they must bear
the full responsibility. Actua 11y, she will have a sufficient
number of units for graduation from Littie Creek or Collegedale,
but under the circumstances neither school can graduat te her.
Since she has met the graduation standards and has enough
units, we are free to let her enter upon college work with
the understanding of course that she does not receive a
'secondary diploma. She and her father understand this and
have taken the responsibility. I thought I would expalin
this to you so that you would understand exactly what has
happened to her and why she is completing this work in the
academy here this year. She is also taking some college work.
With very kindest regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
jr
G. E. Shankel, Academic Dean
