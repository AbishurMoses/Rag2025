Gentlemen:
I would very much appreclate your sending me a copy of your
psychology book entitled, "Individual Behavior." I possibly will
be using this book in my class this year and would appreciate
receiving a copy for perusal.
Thank you very much for your kind service.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
