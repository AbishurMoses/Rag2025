Dear Mr. Shadel:
I am the advisor to the Student Scholarship Committee at Southern
Missionary College. The officers of this group are very ansious
to present a good lecture series for the students this coming
academic year. Consequently, they have mentioned your name
several times as a possible speaker.
Since Mrs. Fleming is your sister, we are wondering if you might
be coming through this way at sometime during the coming school
year. If your itinerary should happen to bring you in the vicinity
of Collegedale, we would be most interested in having you address
our student body at an assembly.
Iwould appreciate any encouragement you might be able to give us
along this line. I believe if we knew enough in advance wheny you
would be coming, we could have an assembly time available. We
would be most happy if something of this nature could be arranged.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
