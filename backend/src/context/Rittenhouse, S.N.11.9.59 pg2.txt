Personally, I would like to see
practice here for a year or
two and get a little money to jingie MeIvey. his pocket so that they
would have the means to do something worth while. The wife and I
are not pianning to influence them in any way, but I have definitely
decided to give up my administrative work, for I will be 66 next
summer. We would like to go with then wherever they go. I would 1ike
to get a littie place and have the fun of doing some gardening and
we would 1ike to be within a few miles of them wherever they are.
This is just a brief resume' of what they aze doing. I hope that sone
day they will have time to sit down and write you more details of the
very interesting program they have this year.
Harvey is doing quite a lot of surgery and is really getting into
big stuff and sone of the top surgeons are highly pleased with his
progress. A few days ago he operated on a man they expected to die
as one of the best surgeons had operated on a sini lar case and the
man did die. But mach to their surprise the man vas up and feeling
we1l in about four days, and the doctors were wondering how Harvey
had such wonderful success. I an Sure Harvey has found his calling
in surgezy and is in his true lifevork.
With very kindest regards and assuring you a11 is we1l with us
both health wise and othe rwise, I an
Very sincerely yours,
