Dear Miss Silloway:
I promised to send you the names of the books by Arnold
Toynbee of recent publication.
There are three or four which I think are worth while;
the names are Civilization on Trial, 1948; Nar and
Civilization, 1951; The World and the West, 1953;
and more zecently, The Fearful Choice.
I an not sure what book publishers handle these. I knou
the Oxford University Press is the publisher of most of
them, but I imagine there are American publi shers as
well. I suppose any publishing house wonld be able to give
that information.
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shanke: 1
