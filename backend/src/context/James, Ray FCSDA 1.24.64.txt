Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dean Cassell:
I did appreciate the opportunity of talking with you concerning our
European tour and your kindness in presenting our request to your
Academic Policies Committee. It appears likely that the Southern
Union will be operating the tour and the program, Things may vary
just a little from the one I outlined to you.
Perhaps I didn't present our plan to you in the form I really meant
to. I really was interested in finding out if you would be interested
in using this opportunity to build a structure that could be college
related in this European experience.
I do want again to say thank you for your kindness and will look
forward to seeing you again at college days if not before, I am
Very sincerely your friend,
G. Ray James, Secretary
