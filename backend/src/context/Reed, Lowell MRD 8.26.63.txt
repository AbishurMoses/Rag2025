Iowa City, Iowa
Dear Lowell:
Iwas most happy to receive your kind letter of August 8,, Many
thanks for the nice things you say. I assure you the feeling is
mutual. I have greatly appreciated the excellent spirit of cooperation
shown by you and others comected with the American College Testing
Program. I am sure you know you don't havecto sell me on this pro-
gram for I am thoroughly convinced of the contribution it is and will
continue to make to American Higher Education.
I have now sent a list df the ACT contact people in our feeder high
schools throughout the south to Mr. W. F. Adams. We are going
forward with our plans to begin the program with the November test
date. As you mentioned, it is better to give the test on the Sunday
following the national Saturday test date thereby permitting scoring
with the students who are taking the test on Saturday.
Again let me say how much I apprectate your cooperation in permitting
us to set up these Sunday test dates. I trust I will have the opportumity
of seeing you again. We would be most happy to have you visit us at
Southern Missionary College.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
