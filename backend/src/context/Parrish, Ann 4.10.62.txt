Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Miss Parrish:
In checking with others of the Anglish Departuent and also
with students uho are in need of Advanced Grammar during the
summer session, we have concluded that it would be to the
advantage of all concerned to teach the class in English
Literature, course nuaber 61,62 for fouricredit hours for
eight weeks; Advanced Grammar, course number 123, three credit
hours for eight weeks and Freshman Composition, course number
1-2, six credit hours for eight weeks. MGiss Lindberg will
teach the Freshman Composition class and we would sppreciate
you teaching the four hours of English Literature. and three
hours of Advanced Grammar giving you a total load of seven
credit hours to be taught in eight weeks.
Thank: your sincerely-
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
