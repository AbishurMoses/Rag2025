Deas Miss Lemon:
Thank you for your letter of inquiry and 3 shall endeavor
to answer the questions conta ined in it.
It would hardly be possible for us to indicate at this time
how much of your credits earned at the Branson Memorial
Ho spital would be accepted toward the Bible Insturctor's
cur riculum. We would need to receive a transcript of your
work at that place and thereafter we would be able to give
you a much clearer picture of what would be expected here.
Rest assured, however, that the Bible which you took in
connection with your R. N. program could be applied toward
the Bible requirements on this campus. SfE it was given on
the basis of Bible teaching in one of our colleges. We
would have to withhold a final answer on this point until
we receive your transeript.
There are hospitals in the area where you would be abie to
work as an R. N. This would involve some commuting, however,
inasmch as the city of Cleveland is located about thirteen
mi les from ouE campus and Chattanooga about eighteen. In
both of these cities you would find it possible to secure
employment.
Under separate cover we are sending you a bulletin with an
application blank. We sincerely hope that it will be pos-
sible for you to attend our college in the future.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
