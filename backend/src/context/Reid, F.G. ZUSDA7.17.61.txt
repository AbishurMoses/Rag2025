Dear Brother Rees,
I am writing to you with respect ta my son, John, who is at present
a secondery school student at Helderberg College. We have decided that we
would like for him to return to the States and take the Twelfth Grade at
Southern Miseionary College. He will probably have more than enough credits
to make him eligible for admission to the Twelfth Grade and if it will be
possible for you to accept him as & boarding student this coming September,
please confirm and I shall see to it that his credits are sent to you from
Helderberg College.
It will be necessary for John to do a considerable amount of work
to defray a part of his school expenses, so I would appreciete lnowing what
the possibilities are for obtaining worlc that is reasonably remunerative.
John was 19 years old the 24th June and is not afraid of hard
work.
Please send the required application forms end we shall complete
and return them to you at an ear ly date.
Very sincerely yours,
PG. Reid
FGR/mmb
