Dear Jack:
Thank you. for your letter of June 9. We appreciate
your contimued interest in us as potential members of
your school family. Good reports continue to filter
through of the excellent piece of work being done at
Southern Missionary College.
For a school of your present size your library budget
is adequate. And the increase for this year demonstrates
the confidence and support of the board.
We 're busily engaged in a full summer school program
with a total enrollment of 598. Dot and I are traveling
to St. Louis for the A.L.A. convention but vacation time
won't come until after summer school. Our vacation will
no doubt consist of another camping trip and perhaps
two or three days at the fair.
It Was good to see you again and see your evident enjoy-
ment in your work at Southern and to hear your report
of progress at a sister institution.
Sincerely yours,
Leonard Hill
