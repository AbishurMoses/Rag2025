Deaz Madam:
We will be pleased to cooperate with the studies presently
being made by Doctor Holland. The mean scores pertaining
to our college may be released to Doctor Holland so long as
identity is withheld.
Perhaps the results of the study will be made available to
us upon completion.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
