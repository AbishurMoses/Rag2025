Dear David:
The chapel period of January 8 has been set aside for class
meetings. It would seem the part of wisdom to use this
occasion to organize the Freshmen Class. We are, therefore,
placing an announcement in the Campus Accent to be distri-
buted during chapel January 5. If for any reason you feel
that this should not be done at this time, please let me
lmow. I would appreciate you being there at the Freshmen
Class organization as the Student Association Vice-President
with the necessary ballot mat terial and perhaps several others
to assist in tabulating the votes.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

P. s. We wi1l meet in the Lynn Wood Ha1l Chape1.
