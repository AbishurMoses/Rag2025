Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Stone:
At a meeting of the President's Council the problem of
grade school children loitering around the campus and especially
the Tabernacle during the Saturday night programs was discussed.
The college has had the policy that grade school children be
with theis parents while attending a progran on this campus.
It is not enough for grade school children to come up with their
parents and sit with then for five minutes and then leave for
purposes of their ou.
We would appreciate if you would get the names of grade
school children not in company of parents and submit such
names to Mr. B. S. Chace, principal of the elementary school.
I am writing hin concerning this problem with the hope that
he will be able to work directly with the pazents concerning
the children whose names are submitted.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
