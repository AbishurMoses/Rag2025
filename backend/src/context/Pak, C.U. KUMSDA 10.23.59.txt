Dear Brother Pak:
Mr. West, our assistant business manager has handed me a note
requesting me to write to you concerning Joseph Kim.
We are happy to have Joseph back in school again for his senior
year, and arehappy to note that he has improved a great deal as far
as his health is concerned. He is now able to carry a normal load
again, thus enabling him toc complete his course in May, 1960.
We are very much pleased with his progress since he has been here.
Joseph is really a fine young man, and we think a great deal of him.
He also has a very fine mind and is really doing very fine work
except that he has difficulty with his English. I have had him
personally in my class and very much appreciate his ability and
fine spirit as well. My opinion is that he will prove of real
service to our cause if given an opportunity. I am not sure as
to what type of work he is best suited for, but I feel confident
that for one thing he would make a very good teacher although he
may do equally good worl in other lines as well. I wish to assuze
you that we are very much pleased with his progress and think
that he wi1l really make a very good worker for the future.
You perhaps know Something of his experience in Korea during the
war. He has had an experience that has meant a great deal to
him. He has improved his opportunities here in America as fully
as possible.
Very sincerely your brother,
G. B. Shanke1, Academic Dean
Jr
