Dear Dr. Schneider:
Thank you very much for your many courtesies to me while I was
on your campus. Your wife is indeed a wonderful cook and I wonder
how you maintain your trim form under that sort of a routine!
It was indeed thoughtful of you to have me to your home and to take
me back to the plane. I greatly enjoyed my visit and am looking forward
to another one in the years to come. .
Sincerely yours,
Mah, /i bhi &
