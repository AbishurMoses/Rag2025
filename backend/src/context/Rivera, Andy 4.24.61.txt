Dear Mr. Riveras
At a meeting of the Finance Comittee it was voted to
pay you $12 per week to teach the academy art class. This
pay will be extended over a period of eight weeks. Thus
your accomt should be credited for a total of $96.
Ne hope these arrangements are satisfactory and we
do appreciate your work in helping us out at this time.
Very sincerely youxs,
