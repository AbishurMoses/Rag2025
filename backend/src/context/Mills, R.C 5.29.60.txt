Dear Brother Mills:
I meant to write to you earlier about getting the key to
the William Miller Church. Perhaps it is not too late
even now.
We are starting on our field school trip tomorrow morning
and will be in New York City over the week-end. Perhaps
I could borzow it for a few days if you could be so kind
as to send it to Brother Austin at the New York Center,
227 Nest 46th Street. I sha1l be glad to return it to
you immediately after its use.
Brother C. L. Taylor and I with the help of Attorney Phelps
got the church into our denominational possession, Attorney
Phelps gave me a key to it which I left wi th the college at
the time I discontinued my work as dean there siy years ago.
I am taking a group of 35 on a field school trip covering
three weeks, but wi1l not visit western New York; hence,
my request that you would be so kind as to forward the key-
tos the New York Center as we wi1l be calling at the William
Miller Church on Tuesday, June 7.
Trusting that you may be willing to do us this favor, I am
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
