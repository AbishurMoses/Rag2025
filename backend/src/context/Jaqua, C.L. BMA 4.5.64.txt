Dear Mr. Jaqua:
Dwant to take this opportunity to express to you and your wife my
appreciation for your hospitality during my recent visit to Bass
Memorial Academy. Rt was a pleasure to get to know you and your
family better and to see the academy for the first time. By and large
I believe you have a very fine program in operation there.
I was especially impressed with the good student morale and the
excellent rapport that exists between the staff and the students. I
believe this is always indicative of a efficient and effective admini-
stration.
Doctor Rees and : will be at Meridian this coming week and want to
talk with you in some detail about the possibillty of an opening here
in student persomnel work. At the present time there is nothing definite
in terms of a change but we realize that this is an area that needs a great
deal of administrativye leadership.
I trust things are going well for you. Please give my best regards to
your wife and & big thank you for the excellent meals she prepared
whiie we were there.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, jr.
Academic Dean
