Dear Doctor Shankel:
Within a few days we will be returning the excess stock
of all the college textbooks.
If you have any special requests regarding the textbooks
before they are returned to the publishers please let us know
as soon as possible.
We would appreciate your relaying this information to
the other teachers in your division.
Thank you for your co-operation in this matter.
Sincerely yours,
