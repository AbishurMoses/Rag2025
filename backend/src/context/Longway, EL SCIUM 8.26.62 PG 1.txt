Dear Brother Longway:
Your plan to present to a1l Chinese students studying abroad,
Spirit of Prophecy books recently published is excellent. We
har ve never had as many of the Far East students come to this
campus as have our West Coast colleges. Occasionally we have
applications from such students.
As far as our records indicate, we have one Chinese student
coming to us next fa1l unless his plans change. Mr. Daniel
Huei-Chieh Liu, 8, Lane 62, Section 2, Chmg-shan Road, North
Taipei, Taiwan, China, should be on our campus this fall.
If we learn of any other students, we shall commonicate with
you.
We sincerely hope that this young man with others who have
come to the states wi1l keep in mind that theix services are
most needed back in the home field. This is always a destressing
matter when students choose to stay in the states even though
they are needed at home.
Scon we wisl be in the midst of our schooi program. We are
contempjating a good year with a large enrollment. Thank you
for corresponding with us and if at anytime, we can be of any
assistance to you in your educational probiems, please let us
hear from you.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schaeides
