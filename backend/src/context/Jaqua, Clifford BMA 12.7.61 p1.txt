Mr. Clifford L. Jaqua, Principal
Bass Memorial Academy
Lumberton, Mississippi
Dear Mr. Jaqua:
We appreciate your inquiry in regard to a good food service
director for your academy. We would be most happy to have
someone from this institution serve the Bass Memorial Academy.
A young lady by the name of Sally Wonderly, a graduate from
this institution and also a CME gradua te from the dietetics
curriculu, wronld satisfy your needs very well. Sally is
presently assisting Mr. Clinton Wall, Food Service Director
at Walla Walla College. We understand that this is a temporary
arrangement and it is also our feeling that Sally would prefer
this area to the northwest. Sally is an A.D.A. member and a
very pleasant girl. There is every reason to believe that
Sally will return to thi s area in the future and it could be
that the Florida Sanifarium and Hospital may wish her services
also.
Other than the above auggestion, we know of no one that we
would recommend to you at this time There age two of our
young ladies finishing their work at Loma Linda University
this year but we do not know whether they would be available
for academy work. The one who would be most able to work with
young people of academy age will probably be married to a
medical student at Loma Linda. The other may need to stabilize
more before aceepting work on an academy level.
We hope we have been of some he 1p to you and if other names
come to mind, you will hear from us again.
Very sincereiy yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
AÃ§adenic Dean
