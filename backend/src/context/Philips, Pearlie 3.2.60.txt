Dear Mrs. Phillips:
We missed you at Sabbath School this last Sabbath.
I hope you have not been ill.
We are making a very definite attempt to enroll as
many of our church members in the Sabbath School as
possible bhis quarter, and I should like to encourage you
to be present every Sabbath if at all possible so as not
only to receive, but also to share with the rest of us
the blessing of your pr√©sence.
I hope you have not been i1l, and furthermore, I hope
to see you in my class this next Sabbath.
Sincerely yours,
G. - E. Shankel
