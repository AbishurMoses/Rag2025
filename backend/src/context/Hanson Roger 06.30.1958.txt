Dear Mr. Hanson:
I feel that I should write to you at this time regarding one oE two
aspects of the music progran for the coming year. Thus far Doctor
Walters has conducted all the correspondence with you, but as dean
of the college I feel that I should contact you at this time regarding
certain details of the work, and especially so now that Doctor Walters
will not be connected with the institution any longer.
At the present time we have a somewhat limited musical staff. and I
anticipate that the present members wi1l really have a full-time job
during the coming school year. My daughter, Virginia Jean Rittenhouse,
whom you may knour under the name of Virginia Jean Shankel, was invited
to teach here this past year, but she has had other interests of a
concert nature and also the organization of the music in the New York
Center. At the present time she is on a European concert tour with the
A1l American Chorus, so she does not wish to be tied down to a fixed
program such as college teaching entails.
Mrs. Ackerman is our voice teacher. She is a person of experience
and is doing a good work.
Mr. Jackson, who has the band work and all the band instruments has
been with us one year. You perhaps have heard of him as he has played
in various parts of the country.
Miss Mabel wood has been at Southern Missionary College for a long
time. She spends her full time teaching organ and piano.
Mrs. Jackson also teaches some piano although not full time.
At the present time we do not have a department head as such and for
the coming year it appears as though the dean will have to assume
certain responsibilities in the organization of the work in the
Music Department. Actually we have been hoping to find someone with
a doctor's degree to head up the Division of Fine Arts, for this was,
part of our contract with the accrediting association to have someone
of this qualification at the head.
