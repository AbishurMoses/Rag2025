Mr. William Straight
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Straight: )
Concerning the graduation occasions, I shall be
glad to go over them with you. One of the
suggestions which I think would be a nice
feature would be a class quartet following the
consecration prayer by the sponsor of the class.
I think there is a fine possibility of getting
a very good quartet, as there is some very good
musical talent in the senior class. I shall
be glad to talk this over with you at your
earliest convenience.
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankei
Academic Dean
