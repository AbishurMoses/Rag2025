Dear Brethren:
This is to inform you that Elder Dyason of
Australia will not be able to meet the appointments
he formerly made to be at the College this week-end.
Elder Dyason met with an accident at the youth
camp here and is confined to the Florida Sanitarium
under the doctor's care, and will not be released
for some time.
It was his desire that we write you and give
you this information.
Sincerely your brother,
LL
H. H. Schmidt, President.
