Walla Walla College
College Place, Washington
Dear Brother Peters:
I apprectate your letter of February 26 in which you outline your needs
for Gem State Academy for the coming school year. Unfortunately, I
have no one to suggest to fill the position of English tescher and librarian.
All of our English majors have been placed and there is no one available
in elther music ar modern languages.
It seems that most of thege individuals are already hired before they
graduate. I trust you will be more successful in personnel elsewhere.
IE I may be of any further assistance, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
