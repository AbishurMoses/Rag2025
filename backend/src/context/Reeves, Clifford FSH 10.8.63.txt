Term.
October 8,1963
Dear Dr.Cassell,
Herewith you will find checks amounting to $700. This
includes $240 from the siz students in Mrs Simmons class on
Fundamentals of Education and $460 from my class on Marriage and
the Fami: ly. I have ten basic nursing students in my class plus
five adults taking the course for credit end thirteen auditing
the course. Included in my class are two doctors of medicine
and five doctors wives . There seems to be a growing awareness
among medical doctors that they need deeper insights and know-
ledge of marital interrolationshipe that produce somatic
symptoms .
We were happy to learn that you and some others from the
College will be coming down to visit this campus in the near future.
We hope to get aequainted with you at that time. Perhaps you know
my brother-in-lew, Dr W.G,Murdoch, dean of the Seminary at Berrien
Springs.
Since you had the leaflets printed stating that the
course in Final Events in God's Program, to be offered next
semester, would not be for credit, there have been some questions
raised by some who had been plenning on it for credit. Perhaps we can
discuss this when you come.
Trusting that you have made a good start in your school
year, and with every good wish for success,
Yours 8 incerely,

re ceived the cash safely which I recently mailed to him
for books. Also what to do about the extra books. Thanks.
