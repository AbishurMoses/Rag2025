Dear Brother Jaqua:
We received the name of Robert L. Conway, 714 17th Street,
Greeley, Colorado as one who is interested in securing a
teaching position in the field of English. Mr. . Conway has
taught at Campion Academy but is presently working on his
master's degree. I believe he will complete this degree this
year. This is the anly suggestion that has come to us which
you may be interested in.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
