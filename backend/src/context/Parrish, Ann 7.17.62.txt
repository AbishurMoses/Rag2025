Miss Ann Parrish
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Miss Parrish:
In Planning office accommodations for a1l of our new and
returning facnlty members, we have had to do some reshuffling.
We are pleased to advise that you may stay in the present
office formerly occupied by Mr. Madgwick. We believe we
have satisfactory accommodations for him elsewhere.
Very sincerely yours,
Milbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
