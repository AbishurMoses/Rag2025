Director of the School Medical Technology
Washington Sanitarium and Hospital
Washington 12, D.C.
Dear Doctor Swatek:
Your letter pertaining to the Medical Technology program at the
Washington Sanitarium and Hospital is most interesting. Also I
appreciate copies of Dean Clark's letter to you explaining the
position of the Loma Linda University in regard to the acceptance
of students for further professional training who have graduated
from the Medical Technology program with a minimum of 96 hours
eaxned on a college campus.
We have this year included in our academic program a degree
program in Medical Technology. The clinical work for our degree
will be taken here in Chattanooga with the Erlanger Hospital or
at the Florida Sanitarium and Hospital. We hope the program is
successful and of course we wouid not hesitate to offer a degree to
a student who would secure his clinical work at the Washington
Sanitarium and Hospital. The student would 6f course have to
complete the requirements as listed in our bulletin.
Thank you for the information in your letter and we hope that our
program will prove successful.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
