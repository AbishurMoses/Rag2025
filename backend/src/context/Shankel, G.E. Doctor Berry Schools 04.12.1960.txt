Dear Dean Shankel:
Thank you for your gracious letter. It was a real pleasure
to see you again and to have a visit with the group from
Southern Missionary College. You always have such interesting
people and it is nice to keep in touch.
I feel that our Christian colleges are more needed than ever
in our world of today. I certainly think of you often and
the fine work being done there.
You were most thoughtful to send the subscription to "These
Times." I shall read it and pass it on to our library. Our
young people enjoy good reading material.
Please remember me to Dr. Kennedy and to all the other nice
people who came with you.
Thank you again. I send best wishes to you and all at
Southern Missionary College for a blessed Easter.
Sincerely yours,
Sns Deny
Inez Henry
