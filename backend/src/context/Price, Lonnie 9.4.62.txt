Dear Mr. Price:
We are enclosing a fos which you may submit in order to
obtain a Government Loan in behalf of your daughter, Carol.
Perhaps it would be weil for me to outline the terms of the
loan in order that you may be fully acquainted with our
practice.
A loan is generally not granted to a freshman until the end
of the first nine weeks of school. By then we are able to
judge the performance of a freshman student and it is less
likely that we will make a mistake in granting loans to those
who are not scholastically eligible. Unless a freshman stadent
has had an enviable scholastic record on the secondary level,
it is a risk for us to extend a loan until he or she has had
the privilege of establishing themselves on this campus. We
have failed in this matter in the past and we do not wish to
zepeat our mistake.
In ordes to qualify for a loan, a student wi1l have had to
achieve a scholastic gradeipoint average of 1.5 which repre-
seats a "B- average oE a "C+". Of course the student's
character is taken into consideration before a loan is extended.
The interest rate of three per cent is not applied until one
year after the student wi1l have finished school or quit school,
whichever the case may be. The joan may be repaid during the
following ten year period. The school is interested in retri-
eving the funds at an earlier date in order to help still other
students, but the student has ten years in which to repay the
loan if he desires to follow such a plan. I should also add
that a student, in Order to qualify for al loan, must take a fail
schgol program consisting of 16 college hours. Should the student
take 12 oE 14 during the school year, it would be necessary for
him to make up the balance during the sumer tesm.
Should you have any other questions, we shall be glad to hear
from you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
