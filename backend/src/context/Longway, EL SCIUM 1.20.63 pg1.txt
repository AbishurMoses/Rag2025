South China Island Union Mission
1000 Chung Cheng Road
Taipei, Taiwan
Dear Brother Longway:
Your service in behalf of the Chinese young people in the states I
am sure will be very much appreciated. We also believe that last
year's morning watch book entitled "Our High Calling" was the best
that we have had. In fact, we are rereading it this year instead of
using the current publication.
We have only one young Chinese lady on our campus at the present
time, namely, Patricia Chu. Last year she attended Pacific Union
College but since her father is a practicing physician in the State of
Tennessee she decided to come here. Patricia of course is very much
Americanized by now but we shall belhappy to give her a copy of this
book.
The young man that wasto reach our campus in time for school the second
semester will not be with us. Our admissions bffice will perhaps relay
this information on to you also. We had word from a doctor in California
asking us to release the young man inasmuch as he chose to stay in
California where his sister is located. I believe his sister is presently
associated with the Glendale Sanitarium and Hospital. Perhaps he feels
his deficiency in the use of English. I doubt seriously whether he plans
to attend any of our schools this year but may take some work at a college
there in Glendale. You should certainly have that information inasmuch
as you sent him over here on the bursary plan. I hope the young man
doesn' 't lose his objective in life and remain here in the states. We
haven't heard from him yet but this particular Chinese doctor on the
West Coast has written us to inform us that the boy will not be with us.
