Atlanta 8, Georgia
Dear Mr. Sweet:
Upon receiving your letter of November 10 we thought it best to prepare
this brief written report covering the three areas mentioned in the letter,
namely: endowment, instructional expenditures and salary arrangements.
Endowment
Southern Missionary College has received its financial support through the
years from two basic sources in addition to tuition and fees. The first
source is from our parent body, the Southern Union Conference of Seventh-day
Adventists with headquarters in Decatur, Georgia, which in turn is a subsidiary
of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists with headquarters in Takoma
Park, Washington, D. C.
You will find enclosed copies of the letters written by the officers of
these two organizations which were included in our 1950 report (when we were
granted our accreditation). These letters set forth the funds made available
through these organizations and pledge their financial support. During the past
few years we have been receiving annually from the Southern Union Conference of
Seventh-day Adventists a base operating subsidy of $70,000 plus additional
operating grants. We have been receiving an average of $150,000 annually from
the same source for capital expansion purposes. These sums are also pledged for
the future.
Our second source of financial support nay be termed an endovment in the
broad sense of the term. Instead of an endovment invested in bonda and stocks,
we have invested the sum of $771,976.46 in College Industries, Inc., and
College Enterprises, Inc. (totally owned subsidiaries of SMC and general
chartered, tax-paying corporations under the laws of the State of Tennessee)
including the buildings and equipment they lease from Southern Missionary College.
These corporations have through the years yielded a substantial return on our
investment in addition to supplying work opportunities to many students.
Students during the past few years have received approximately $200,000 per year
from their work in these industries. The industries included in these two
corporations with their anmal profits are as follows:

Our investment in these operations has been increasing yeas by year. The profit
for the past four years listed above based on the latest investment figures has
yielded an average xeturn on investment of 6 per cent.
The income has now become more stable due to the fact that the college has
leased its farm and has erected buildings housing a cabinet shop, bakery, and
clinic which are leased to organizations not owmed by the college and on a fixed
rental basis.

TO WHOM IT MAY Ã‡ONCERN:
This is to certify that the Southern Missionary College, of Collegedale,
Temnessee, is one of eight senior colleges operated by the Seventh-day
Adventist denomination in the United. States. This college is a subsidiary
unit of the Southern Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, (Address:
Box 449, Decatur, Georgia) which organization assues the immediate responsi-
bility for its financial support and management. In addition to the financial
support which the college recei ves directly from the Southern Union Conference,
there is an annual transfer of funds back to the Southern Union fros the
General Conference, which provides additional financial stability for the
operation of the college. This fund over the last five years has averaged
$37,844.02 annually.
Throughout its history the General Conference has maintained a large
reserve in cash and other assets to insure stability and continuance of its
member institutions in times of depression or financial crisis. Appropriations
from this reserve fund are voted by the General Conference Committee to support
denominational institutions, such as colleges, hospitals, publishing houses,
or other institutions that come upon financial difficulties. Every year these
appropriations run into hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Throughout its operation Southern Missionary College has not been in such
financial difficulty that General Conference funds have been needed to help in
the operation of the school. However, on several occasions funds have been voted
from the General Confe ere ence to assist in the building and expansion progran,
We have no hesitancy in setting forth this long-established relationship
for the information of interested parties.
Cordially yours,
(Signed)

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
This is to certify that the Southern Missionary College, of College-
dale, Temessee, is incorporated undez the laws of the State of Tenn-
essee and is operated by a Board of Trustees which assumes entire
responsibility for the financial support and management of the
institution. The college is a subsidiary unit of the Southern Union
Conference of Seventh-day Adventists and as such has the financial
backing of the Southern Union Conference. This organization has a
steadily increasing annual income, which for the year 1949 amounted
to $1,900,000, The Southern Union Conference, as the parent
organization, supports Southern Missinnary College and is responsible
with the full resources of the parent body for the obligations of
the college.
As an established practice and by the vote of its managing body, the
Southern Union Conference pays to the college annually a fixed
basic operating subsidy of $40,000. This subsidy for the instructional
department is guaranteed to the college in lieu of an endowment
income.
In addition to this annual operating subsidy of $40,000 the Southern
Union Conference provides funds for the construction of new build-
ings and other expansion projects on the campus. Duri ing the period
1944-1950 this expansion fund has averaged $100,000 annually. The
Southern Union Conference is pledged to continue this program of
expansion and betterment.
It is a pleasure to review this relationship and to bring these
facts tofthe attention of interested persons.
