La Sierra College
Arlington, California
Dear Richard:
We agree with you that ranking a student in his class is of
more value than the grade point average. Most of the trans-
cripts which we xeceive from our academies and high schools
in this field do rank the senior students.
While on vacation during the past three weeks, I have had
opportunity to read your recent book entitled, "The Protestant
Dilemma." This is an outstanding piece of work. In reading
the book, I find myself enlarging on the arguments presented
which gives me reason to believe that you had a difficult time
confining your arguments to the pages involved. This is as 1t
should be. You have not allowed extraneous material to serve
as argument. I hope that this book is widely distsibuted and
widely zead by all of our people. It is the most excellent
argument in defense of the Sabbath I have read to date.
We are pleased to welcome to this campus the teachers from our
several colleges coming here for the sectional meetings. The
new ladies dormitory will house them even though there are
some little jobs to be completed in that building. Ne are so
happy to have this building which will house all of our young
ladies, but it seems that it will be necessary to enlarge it
by way of the planned wing within a year or so.
We are anticipating a good school year and hope it wi1l be
possible for us to give the young people the values which
they will need in the near future.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
AÃ§ademic Dean
