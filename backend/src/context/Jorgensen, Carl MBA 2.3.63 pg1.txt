Mr. Carl Jorgensen, Principal
Monterey Bay Academy
Box 191
Watsonville, California
Dear Carl:
It was a pleasure visiting with you on the phone the other day and to
learn of your needs for next year. Perhaps by now you have endeavored
to get in touch with Jean Schmidt whom we recommended to you for
English and Spanish. I believe that Jean would be able to do it without
any difficulty. Jean has been a hard worker and a very fine scholar.
She appears to be a genuine Christian and would exemplify the standards
of the church.
We certainly also can recommend the name of Lindley Richert for
English but he would not be able to handle your Spanish. Lindley is a
fine looking young man and would be able to handle himself very well.
We would zecommend him also without reservation.
Harriet Stamper will be going to Highland AÃ§ademy as dean of women
and Judy Fowler is already at Lynwood Academy. Marilee Easter,
another English major,of excellent scholarship, is rather anxious to
go west and teach. Marilee will make a very fine teacher but may still
lack a lttle bit of maturity. I would not be afraid to use her, however.
We have a fine group of Eaglish majors graduating this year.
We have at least three men that would not hesitate to teach the Industrial
Arts, but it is not possible for them to handle the pxinting. Iam sorzy
that we are not able to help you out in this area. In the field of Biology
I would not hesitate to recommend Mr. Bruce Kopitzke who claims
California as his home state. Bruce would be very energetic and I am
sure that you would appreciate having him on your staff. Bruce has a
lovely little wife who is assisting us in our physical education department.
We are sending you under separate cover one of our senior placement
brochures. These of course are not to be released until February 15,
