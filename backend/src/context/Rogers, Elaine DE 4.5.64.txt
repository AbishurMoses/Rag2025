Dear Elaine:
I appreciate the information you sent on Donald Hunt Miller and the
information you gave me on the phone relative to speech teachers.
We have followed up several of these leads and believe that one may
be a possibility.
We appreciate the good work that you age doing and your willingness
to be of service.
Best wishes to you.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
