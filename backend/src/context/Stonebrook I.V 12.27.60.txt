Dr. Wilbert M. Schneider, Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College,
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Schneider: .
Your very kind letter and booklet, presenting the Senior Class of 1961,
has jus t come to my desk, and I wish to state how much this is appreciated.
Some of our other colleges figure that the costs or the preparation of Such
a bocklet is not equal to the value received, but I can certainly state that
15 far as we superintendents are concerned, that we certainly are grateful
for the booklet and the materials that are given there in.
It appears that we are going to have quite a turn over in teachers this
year. Last year we only had five or six changes out of 60 teachers, which
was marvelous, but this year it looks like things are getting back to form.
I may be over that way one of these days to see some of these fine youth
that you have finishing college this spring.
We are glad to know that you are at Southern Missionary College, and I can
only believe that the folls there are most happy for your services.
Looking forward to renewing eur former acquaintance, and wishing you a most
pleasant Holiday Season.
Sincerely your friend,
ubrk
