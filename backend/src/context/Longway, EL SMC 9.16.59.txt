Dear Brother Longway:
I have thought of you any times since our pleasant contacts at South
Lancaster many years ago, and I enjoy your reports of the work over there
in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Ne have a student who came to us here last year
by the. name offames (Hung-Ju) Chu ho tells us that he was a student
at the China Training Institute curing his high school years and that
be took eighteen semester hours of work iollowing that in Hong Kong.
I am wondering whether you have any of the records of our China Training
Institute; and if 3o, whe ther you could suppiy us with a record- of
his work taken there.
He is having a difficult time learning Snglish, and I sonetines wonder
whether it is profitable for him to be here in school. He has a brother,
I believe in Kentucky, who is a doctor and I believe the one fostering
him. He tells ae that he has been a Seventh-day Adventist for some
fourteen years, and I understand that he has soje place in the work
while in China.
I wonder if you can give me anything of his background and whether he
has actually been a worker there some time or other. We are anxious
to help him all we can, but even after having been here a year his
English is exceedingly hard to understand. I do not Imow whether he
wi1l learn enough of it to make a go of it in the English medium or not.
Any information you can give we will be very happy for.
Very sincerelyyours,
G. B. Shankel
