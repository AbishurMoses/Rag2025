Dear Brother Shankel:
Thank you very much for your kindness in providing
a speaker for us at Dalton last Sabbath. I sincerely ap-
preciate your willingness to shoulder that responsibility
for me; > and I know the folk here at Dalton appreciate it,
too. .
I am wondering, Brother Shankel, if it would be pos-
sible to have your services on Sabbath, November 1 ? I be-
lieve you will enjoy getting acquainted with our folk here
in Dalton, and I know they will appreciate any message you
might have for them.
Please drop me a card at your earliest convenience
with reference to the above mentioned date.
Many, many thanks.
Yours in the Work,
MI. Rihhic
