Dear Dr. Schneider: :
I have your letter regarding Bill Mundy who is
available to teach Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry.
We are not in need of a teacher in this subject field
but do trust that he will work out in another school
and I am sure that there will be no difficulty in find-
ing him a place.
We are vey happy with Judy Fowler, she has fit into
out school real well and is doing a good job here at the
Lynwood Academy. We feel very fortunate to have been
able to get her at the mid-term as we did this year.
Thanking you for your interest and your kindness,
I am.
Very sincerely yours,
NLP ch
