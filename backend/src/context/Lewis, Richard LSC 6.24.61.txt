Dear Doctor Lewis:
My attention has been called to the fact that several
colleges and mmiversities in our part of the vorld are
not accepting transfer grades of "D's" regardless of the
issuing institution, There seems to be sone nerit in such
a policy and I an personally wondering what our own college
deans think of such a policy for our own institutions.
A grade level of "D is of little value and so often a
tender heazted teacher gave the grade when actually an
"p" would have been in order. This is not always true,
but certainly eaperience has taught this lesson. We
are not at this time prepared to indicate what we tould
do in regard to suchi a policy, but I an sonewhat persuaded
in that direction. Let me know what you think of such a
policy.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
