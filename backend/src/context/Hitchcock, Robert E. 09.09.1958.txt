Dear Mr. Hitchcock:
Thank you for your letter of September 3 in
which you inquize as to the possibilities of
teaching in this institution.
I see that your qualifications are very good
indeed. May I say that, this being a denominational
college, it is our practice to employ only members
of our owm organization. Since this is the case,
we of course are not able to give consideration
to requests other than fron members of our own
religious organization.
Thank you for your inquiry. I am
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
