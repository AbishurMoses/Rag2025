Dear Elder Ray:
Plans are now under way for the Faculty Colloquium this fall. In discussing
the program last year with various faculty members, Ifound that there was
a desire to havemore faculty participation. Consequently, Ihave chosen
five pextinent topics dealing with the teaching process that should be of
current interest to the faculty.
Because of your experience and education, I would Ike to ask you to serve
as one of the discussants in the group discussing "What responsibilities do
we have to the college teaching profession as teachers in a church related
college." Your presenter will be Doctor Gordon Hyde. He will pxobably be
getting in touch with you in the near future to plan the strategy for the pre-
sentation of your topic. Rt is very likely that he will ask you to do some
research into one aspect of the topic or topics to be discussed and make a
brief presentation to the group. After he has presented the topic and you and
your fellow discussants have had an opportunity to enlarge upon his presentation
or discuss the topic under consideration, those faculty members in attendance
will also have an opportunity to express their opinions. Iwould Ike to see
some very stimulating and active participation on the part of the faculty
members in attendance. I feel confident that you will be able to make an
excellent contribution to the topic discussed in your group.
If you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
