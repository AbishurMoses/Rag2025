Atlanta 8, Georgia
Dear Mr. Sweet:
In the absence of the President, I am passing on to
you the report which I believe is due in your office
October 1.
In certain respects we believe there is an improvement
over previous reports. In other respects we find room
for considerable improvement. When I came here a feur
months ago to serve as ecademic dean, I sensed certain
areas which are in need of strengthening, and a future
report wi1l show that we have already begun to strengthen
some points in the scholastic area. I will be happy to
use my many years of experience as an academic dean
to build up the scholastic phase of the program.
I hope that we have submi tted sufficient documentary
mai terial in Support of the figures given. It is some-
times difficult to know just how elaborate the supporting
evidence shouid be, but we tried to maintain what I
hope to be a proper balance in this respect.
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
ja
Academic Dean
