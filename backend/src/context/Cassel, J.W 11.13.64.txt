Dear Doctor Cassell:
This is to request your opinion of the questions in the enclosed
questionnaire. You will note that it is focused on the subject of
commitment to the Seventh-day Adventist educational system and its
objectives. The questionnaire in its final form will be used to
collect some data on commitment as perceived by Adventist teachers
and which Ieneed'for preparing my doctoral dissertation in education.
After each item in the questionnaire, you will note the follow-
ing : "( O.K.
O.K. with suggestions
delete)." If you
feel that a question or item is satisfactory as it is written,
place a check mark in the blank before "O.K." If you feel the item
should be improved, place a check mark in the blank hefore "O.K.
with suggestions, and indicate in the space designated for sug-
gestions below the question what your suggestion is for improving
the question. If you feel that the item ignnot germane to commit-
ment, place a check mark in the blank before "delete."
Questions 1 through 12 are primarily for obtaining biographical
data which may have S ome bearing on how one would answer the re-
maining questions. You may be interested to know that my disser-
tation chairman is agreeable to the questionnaire being used in
its present form. However, I feel that our college presidents and
academic deans may have some suggestion to offer which will im-
prove the instrument. I will be grateful to you for taking time to
read the questions and to indicate for each approval, suggestions,
or deletion.
After you have checked your reactions in the spaces indicated
on the questionnaire, will you kindly return it in the enclosed
self-addressed envelope. Thank you for doing this favor for me.
Singerely yours,
