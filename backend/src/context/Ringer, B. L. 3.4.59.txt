Dear Fac culty Member:
Starting September, 1959-60 school year, Southern
Mercantile Agency book store is going to institute a
new book sale program. This progran will include
something many teachers and = sudents have been asking
for--the selling of used books.
It is our plan to purchase used books from the
students in May of this year for re-sale next September.
In order to do this we must have a list from each teacher,
of the texts that are being used at the present time
which you will continue to use next fall. Before buying
any of these books back, we must have the assurance that
these texts will not be revised or changed. In order for
this sys tem to work efficiently, it will be necessary to
have this information in to Dean Shankel's office by April
25.
As you can see, this is imperative in order to make
an effective book list which we will use as a guide in
buying used books.
We feel confident that with your help this new
policy will be quite efficient and effective. Your CO-
operation and help on this matter will be greatly appre-
ciated.
Thank you,
SOUTHERN MERCANTILE AGENCY
