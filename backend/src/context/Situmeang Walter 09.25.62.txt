Dear Sir,
Rev. H. M. S. Richards, Voice of Prophecy Speaker, suggested me to
write you regarding the possibility of my admittance into Southern Missi-
onary College.
I am Walter Situmeang, 32 years old, a Seventh-day Adventist from
Djakarta, In dones ia. I met Mr. & Mrs. Richards early last year in Dja-
karta while they were visiting our church.
Since May 28, 1961, I have been in Berry College, Mount Berry, Ge-
orgia. This institut: ion is interdemncminational. I am in a workc-study
program - alternately working in one semester and studying in the next
semester and so on. My personal, incidental and medical expenses are
provided by Berry College's Internat: ional Student Aid Fund. I like the
program in Berry College, however, as a Seventh-d day Advent ist I would
like to attend one of our institut: ions if I could have the same oppor-
tunity.
I don't have any financial resource in United States, nor I could
expeot from In dones: ia due to the Indonesian Foreign Exchange Regulation.
But I oould do a good and responsible administrat: ive job. I had had al-
most four years exper: ienoe work in ICA/Amerioan Embassy, Djakarta. My
latest positi ion was Administrative Assistant & Paymaster.
I thank you very much for your attention and cons iderati ion.
Sinoerely yours,
LL
Warl-p
Walter Situmeang
