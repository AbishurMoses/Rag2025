Dear Brother Shankel:
I understand our senior colleges have a placement
folder of their gra duates which includes pictures,
list of degrees, major and minor fields, marital
status, age, experience, and choice of work.
If Southern Missionary College has such a folder
for the Class of 1959, I would appreciate receiving
a copy.
Sincerely yours,
