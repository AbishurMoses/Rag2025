Dear Professor Shankel:
I have now had the report of two readers on your DEVELOPMENT
OF INDIAN POLICY IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, and both readers agree
that a revision and a rewriting should be undertaken. The
essential parts of the readers' reports are submitted to you
in the hope that you will want to give serious consideration
to a thorough revision.
I urge you to revise and resubmit the MS. If you can do it
soon enough, my present readers may be willing to change their
qualified approval to complete approval. If you take a con-
siderable amount of time, I may have to send the revised version
to another reader, but I would not now give up hope of publi-
cation if I were you.
Sincerely yours,
CmRes
