Dear Pellow Deanss
Znasnch as I heve beea absent fron the office of a deen for
the paet $w yesrs, St is necessary fos me to catch up on soe
recent develpments.
Recentiy we geceived a reqpest fron a student for credse In the
couse thich is offered on the lona Landa capus cach year by OUE
Aaerican Teporance Society. Mis progran has been dizected by
Dy. Minton Deaves for several years, and firon a1s that se have beard,
there seens to be a hig respect for the learing eperierices whiie
ettending the schoos of Scientific Studies an Alcohollon.
Defore w offer credst in this area on ous capus, M woula wish
to low shet the other colieges da in this xegard. It is not the
wisest procadure to give credie in sonething that is not Jiated in
a college balletis. 1, on the Lans Ianda capus, the course weze
listed, Se would not be too dafficust to give credie on a transfer
basis. Perlps sone thought ouphe to be givas to the Enclusion of
such a course in o o buietins.
Hould you Bindly let ne lnnour uhat you are doing in your
respective institution. Teghaps I could trananit the information
after compiling 1t upon the receipt of letters fxon you. AE the
present tine W are merety interested an at you are doing on your
capuses ln reganis $o the granting of credss for the workt taten by
students on the lona Linda capus during the seE period.
MSta Bindest regazds to alz of you and a wish for a good
1960-61 achool year.
Very sincerely yours,
1aibert M. Schoeides
Acadenic Dean
