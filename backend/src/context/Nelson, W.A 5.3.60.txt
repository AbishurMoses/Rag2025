Seventh-day Adventist

Brookfield, Illinois
Dear Brother Nelson:
Dean Taylor has handed me your letter of inquiry
of April 19 and I think he has already expressed
the fear that we do not have any secretarial
graduates available. They were all taken
several months ago and at the present time we
do not have anyone to offer at all. In fact
all our two year secretarial students are taken,
although I believe we do have one or two of them
that have not been definitely placed.
However, I see that you have a definite preference
for four year graduates and I do not blame you for
specifying that as a strong preference.
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean

Mr. W. H. Taylor
Dean of Student Affairs
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Brother Taylor:
We are in need of two secretaries for the Illinois
Conference Office.
We will need a girl beginning June 1 for the Home
Missionary and Sabbath School Departments, and a girl beginning
August 1, or September 1, to serve as receptionist and switch-
board operator. When she is not busy, she would also do work
for the Treasury Department.
We have beautiful apartments, completely furnished,
for our single girls, and these apartments are within walking
distance of the Conference Office. Our office building is new
and the working conditions are pleasant.
We would prefer to have four-year graduates from
the Secretarial Department.
If you have married girls to recommend, their
husbands could no doubt find work in this Chicago area. The
Hinsdale Sanitarium is just five miles from the Brookfield
Conference Office.
I would be interested in hearing from you as soon
as possible.
Very sincerely,
