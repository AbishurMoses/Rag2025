Dear Elder Perry:
I appreciate your interest in our 1964 graduates. Unfortunately all
of the individuals you mentioned in your letter have already been
placed. The need for elementary teachers is very great in the
conferences here in the Southern Union and most of these people
have conference scholarships. Consequentiy, they are commited
to their conferences for a year or more.
I wish it had been possible for me to send you further information
on some of these individuals, but unfortunately this is not the case.
If I may be of any further service to you, please feel fee to contact
me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
