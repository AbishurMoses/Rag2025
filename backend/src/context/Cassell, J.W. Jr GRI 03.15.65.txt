Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Cassell:
According to your suggestion I am submitting the expenses for the
recent trip to Southern Missionary, which are as follows: :
Mileage, 1,216
$85.12
Per diem, 2 days
10.00
$95.12
It was certainly a pleasant experience to visit your campus. I was
impressed by the beautiful layout there in the country valley, by the
plans for development and expansion which we heard of, and by the atten-
tive student body. Elder Davis and Dr. Kuhlmann very kindly showed me
around the campus, and I found the hospitality at the dormitory most
cordial and pleasant.
Sorry to have missed you, but when you are up this way again, stop
in and see us at Geoscience.
Sincerely yours,
R. M. Ritland
RMR/rw
