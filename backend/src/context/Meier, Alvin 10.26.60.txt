Dear Alvin:
It was very kind of you to loan $500 to Mr. Crawford who is a senior
business student on this campus. Mr. Crawford is a fine young man, and
wishes to finish his work while he is at it.
It may be of interest to you to know that Mr. Crawford has had to work
his way, not only while in school, but before that, he has al lways had to
finance his entire program without help from home. This he has done from
the time that he could barely help himself. You may rest assured that he
will not use these funds unwise ly. In fact, he wi1l not use the funds a1l
at one time, and if he sees toward the end of the year that some of the funds
wi1l not be needed, he wi1l get in touch with you and return whatever he
will not need to finish,
Some of us who are working with students appreciate a few friends
around who are able to he 1p these students in a financial way. Mr. Crawford
has this,to his credit--he did not ask for a scholarship as a gift, but
for funds on a loan basis which he wi1l have to pay back as called for.
It is true that a businessman in Orlando has given him some scholarship
funds for which he is grateful, but even in this case, he has stated that
he wi1l pay these funds back to the school in order that some other student
may be helped in the future. This demonstrates to me that the young man
has depth of character.
We understand that you have been having considerable rain lately. We
hope that all of you have been able to plant your wheat in time to secure
adequate growth.
With kindest regards to you and yours and any of our friends, we aze
always
Cordially yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
