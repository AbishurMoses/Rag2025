Dear Mrs. Hefferlin:
At a meeting of the Finance Committee it was voted to pay
you $4.50 weekly beginning September 13 for your services
in teaching the Social Ethics class consisting of one hour
credit. In addition, it was agreed to pay you $88 for the
eleven weeks of supervision of the Nursery School. We
understand that this is to begin October 1 and last until
December 18.
We sincerely appreciate your services and hope that the
above figures are satisfactory.
Very sincerely yours,
