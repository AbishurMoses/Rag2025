Dear Doctor Leffler:
Thank you for your letter of May 15. After reading it I
called Dr. Cassel saying that 1t would be impossible for me to
get my degree this summer with two weeks of special reading and
the regular second session. Buti he told me he thought I could,
So let's have another "go at it."
You say it would be impo ssible for me to take the nine
term hours and my comprehensives in half of the summer session,
Would you consider granting me credit for my three hours of
science taken at PUC extension in '59? This was a very valuable
course to me and I have used ita inspiration to specialize in
science 4-6, compiling a sound ourriculum which includes a
lab class which the children thoroughly enjoy.
I should like very. much tg get the degree since I am 80
close to it, but I find it impos sible to arrive on campus at
the beginning of the first Bession. It is scheduled too close
to the closing of our schools here in the New York Conference,
Perhaps you would conaider one session of next summer.
I know you are extremely pusy this time of year, but I have turned
down several good calls in th√© hopes I could qualify for Southern
Missionary College. So I hopesome expedient solution can be
found for the benefit of us 11.
Most sincerely,
77
