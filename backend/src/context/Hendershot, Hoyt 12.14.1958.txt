Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Elder Hendershot:
In planning for the Wednesday chapel periods for
the next few months we have thought that it might
be well to reserve one Wednesday shortly after the
Weelt of Prayer for necessary following up of the
Operation Fireside. We are suggesting that Bider
Nelson be asked to take Wednesday, March 18, with
the topic "Hotr to Maintain the Spiritual Glowr."
The committee is asking you to take the following
Wednesday, Narch 25, for any special work or special
message that you may find appropriate following up
the effort of the Week of Prayer.
I shall be glad to hear from you as to thether this
appointment is possible, and later on you may wish
to give us the topic or material you plan to present.
Thank you for your consideration. I an
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
