Dr. Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Schneider:
I received this morning the booklet presenting the members of the S.M.C.
Senior Class of 1962. This is very good promotion and the booklet is very nicely
arranged.
I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the book to discover that you
are now in dean's work. Undoubtedly you still enjoy an occasional class along
the business lines. At least, it is difficult for me to visualize your leaving
the classroom entirely, for you have such a fine way of inspiring students. I
often recall, with pleasure, the privilege I had of sitting in some of your clas-
ses at Walla Walla College.
As you see, I am now the treasurer of the Alberta Conference. Our member-
ship is about 3,200. We have a senior college in our area, which presents various
problems in school finance, since I am a member of the finance committee and also
the school board.
You maybe interested in knowing that before coming to Alberta last March,
it was my responsibility to set-up a pay-by-mail plan for Canada. After studying
various plans and accounting systems I set-up the machine accounting for this plan
on a new Olivetti bookkeeping machine. Setting up an entirely new business office
and the accounting was a real thrill for me, and as yet, I understand, the present
accountant has made no changes in the accounting system. Apparently it is working
quite well.
