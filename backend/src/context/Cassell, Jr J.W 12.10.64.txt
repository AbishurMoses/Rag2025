Mount Pisgah Academy
Candler, North Carolina
Dear Jim:
Iwant to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to you and
your faculty for the hospitality and kindness extended to us while we
were on yourcampus. Doctor Futcher and I were very pleased with
the opportumities we had to talk with your faculty, the senior class
and the juniors. I believe these contacts were most beneficial and
I was very happy to try to dispell some of the doubts the students
had conceming the academic program at Southern Missionary college.
Overall I felt there was a very positive attitude toward the college
and I believe we will have the privilege of serving many of your 1965
graduates.
Let me assure you that we support you fully and are most pleased
with the support you and your faculty are giving us. I believe there
aze great years ahead for the academies of the Southern IUnion and
Southern Missionary College and the continued preparation of the
young men and women of this area for a place in God's work.
Best wishes to you and your family for the holidays and the new year .
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
