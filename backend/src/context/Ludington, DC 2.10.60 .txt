Dear Brother Ldington:
I have planned for sometime to write to you in as much as we have a
slight change of plans. I was planning to terminate my work here
the end of May, but just recently they have persuaded me to conduct
a three-week History trip to New England. This begins the day after
graduat tion and runs wntil June 10, a matter of three weeks. I do
not know just what your plans are, but I thought I better write you
as early as possible. Of course, even after June 10 it will take
a few days for us to get all our things out.
Ne do not knom yet where se wiil be going as Harvey's and Virginia's
plans are not definite. Zhey may go to the mission field or they
may possibly stay in this country. However, wherever they go, we
wi1l be going with them. We will either store our things in June
or take them with S. Some of these things camot be determined
at the moment. I believe the downstairs apartaent was vacant for
about a month during January but two of the nursing stadents tha t
have come back to finish are in the apartment, Ms. Lake and his
wife. Ronnie Noble just got his things out. It was quite a
collection and took hin sometime to gather everything toge ther.
We hope that things are going well with you. We are continuing
a good year and the spirit at S.M.C. seems to be better than
ever at the present time. Las
Last evening we had the farewe: 11 for Eider and Mrs. Beckner. As
you have doubtless heard we are having changes in this part of the
world. The new president of this conference is Brother MeKee and
our new minister will be Eider Thurmon.
Nith very kindest regards, I am
Sincerely your brother,
