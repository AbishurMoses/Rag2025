Dear Blder Longway:
Doctor Rees asked me to write to you regarding your letter d
September 7 conceming James Tsai Shu-teh. It was not clear from
your letter whether the South China Island Mission is sponsoring
Brother Tsat on the bursary plan or whether he is coming to this
country to study independently. If he is coming to study on his own,
he will have to come on a student visa and will have to have a thousand
dollar advance deposit.
We are very happy to learn that he is interested in Southern Missionary
College and that he wants to continne his education. We will be more
than glad to work with him in anyway that we can within the limitations
af our policy and the laws in the United States relative to foreign students.
We will look forward to hearing from you relative to Brother Tsai's
status.
Most sincerely: yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
