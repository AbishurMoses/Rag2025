Dear Brother in Christ;
This is a letter of inguiry relative to one of your
students, Charles Williem Hesler. This man has
written to us inquiring about mission service.
He has a special tie to Ecuador in that his wife
is an Ecustorian. There is reason for him to be
looking this way for employment.
Could you give us a word as to the advisability
of a future mission call for him?
what capacity could he best serve in and could he
be reccommended by the college on graduation?
Thanking you f or your answer to this letter and
with every good wish for you in your work I sm
Sincerely yours,
