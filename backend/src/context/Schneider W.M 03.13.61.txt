Spokane 53, Washington
Dear Clair:
In correspondence with Percy, he indicated that you had left
the employ of the Loss Linda Food Company and that you are
presently engaged in the selling of insurance in the Spokane
area. I was sorry to learn of this turn of events, and I an
sure that the men of the Loma Linda Pood Company were most
reluctant in releasing you.
I an not acquainted with the details of your involvement;
however, this doesn't matter. I only wish to extend a word of
encouragement that you may not despair in seeking first the
kingdom of God. lle aze a1l interested in you, Clair, as a brother,
and we are anxious that you put on the entire armor to withstand
the wiles of the evil one. Our interest in you has not faltered,
and although the scars are sonetines deep, forgiveness is ample.
The Lord has not agreed to remove the scars, but He has suggested
that forgiveness to the penitent sinner is nevez withdrawn.
We invite you to continue your walk toward the kingdom in
spite of the pitfalls that have been in your way. May God grant
you victory, success, and a joyful Christian experience as you
turn your face to the future.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
