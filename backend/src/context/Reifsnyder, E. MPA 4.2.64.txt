Dear Dean Cassell:
One of our teachers nas appiied for educational
allowance for his child who is taking a Biology
course on the West Coast and the Board nas
instructed me to write to you this question.
Do you give a Degree in Biology and if you do, do
you teach Desert and Marine Ecology? We need your
answer in order to ascertain whether we can give
him an educational allowance.
Thank you very much.
Sincerely,
