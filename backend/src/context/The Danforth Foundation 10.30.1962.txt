Gentlemen:
We wish to nominats the following two men for your consideration
as candidates for the Danforth Graduate Fellowships. The firet
is Mr. Ronald Numbers who will be completing his work with a
major in Mathematics. Mr. Numbers is an outstanding student
and is presently serving as president of our Student Association.
You may address him as follows: Mr. Ronaid Numbers, Talge
Hall, Southern Missionary College, Collegedale, Tennessee.
The second nominee is Mr. Jon Williams who will be finishing
his work with a major in the Social Sciences. He, too, is a
good student and should do very well on the graduate level.
His address is Collegedale, Tennessee.
As your campus representative, I have been derelict in
making these nominations. It was my thought that these
students should be applying directly to you, but Mr. Numbers
corrected me in this notion drawing my attention to the fact
that as your liaison officer, Iwould have to make the nominations.
Therefore, the delay. We hope that it is not too late to have these
young men considered. Both have expressed a keen interest in
securing this award and I am indeed sorry that I have delayed
the nominations.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
