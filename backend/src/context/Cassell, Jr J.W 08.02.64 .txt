Dear Janice:
It is true that Southern Missionary College no longer offers a major
in Church and Community Services. Women wanting to go into Bible
work are now directed toward the major in Theology with certain
variations in courses for women. Students interested in going into
Social Work, Counseling and Guidance, and related fields are directed
to our new degree which is a B.S. in Community Services. You will
find this program outlined on page 53 of the 1964-65 bulletin.
As you will notice, this new major is more heavily concentrated in
the area of the behavioral sciences. We believe it better meets the
need for students wanting to go into the mental health professions.
As you probably know, there is liule demand any more for Bible
workers. Consequently, we do not encourage a student to take a
Theology major with special emphasis in Bible work since the opportunities
for placement are very scarce.
If you should have any further question concerning these programs,
please feel free to contact me.
Most sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
