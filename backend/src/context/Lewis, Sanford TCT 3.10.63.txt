Dear Dr. Cassell:
I am told by Don Crook, of the Fine Arts
Division, that you were responsible, to a large
in making the arrangements to allow the Chorale degree, to
appear at our annual Tristate Future Farmers of America
Banquet last night.
For this I wish to convey a great, big
thank you. I know the small donation we were abie
to make toward the college public relations fund does
not nearly cover the value of the group ts appearance
to our banque but perhaps in terms of good will to
the community 1 know it was certainly appre ciated.
Everyone I have talked to about the
performance was highly impressed and, as a former
student of SMC, I couldn 't help but be a little
proud myself.
Again, thanks so much for helping us
out on such a short notice.
Sincerely,
Sarfad feviy
