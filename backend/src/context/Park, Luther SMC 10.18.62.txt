Honolulu 3, Hawais
Dear Luther:
We were so very pleased to receive the amiversary edition of
your Honolulu paper. It was very interesting to us in that it
covered the development of various facets of the economy in the
island. Thanks again for sending us this anniversary edition.
The school year is moving along very nicely here at Southern
Missionary College. We hope that t you, too, are experiencing
the blessings of heaven. Your work should prove to be very
interesting and wwe hope that you will continue to remember us
in this place. If it were possible, we would surely come to
see you. Perhaps after our fanily is more grown, it will be
possible for the wife and I to travel a little more than ue have.
It was a genuine privilege to see some of the old friends during
the General Conferen√ße Session in Prisco this summer. I note with
interest that Joln Griffin is now treasurer of the Idaho Conference,
Irvin Gray of the Montana Conference, and I believe Luther Crooker
has gone to the Union Conference as treasurer. Art Spoo from
Walla Walla College was called to the Union, but he chose to stay
as Business Manager of the college. I take my hat off to him for
this choice. Dick Dutro is in the upper Columbia Conference Book
and Bible House and I suppose some of the other fellows are
scattered throughout the earth. Clifford Burgess is now the
patients Business Manager at the Portland Senitarium and Hospital.
You will remember that Clifford Burgess and his wife served in
India in treasurer's work for a period of time. I suppose you
see a number of the people inasmuch as the islands represent a
stopover for the missionaries going to the various parts of the
world.
Let us hear from you as you find time to write. We would enjoy
some first-hand information concering the work in the islands.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
