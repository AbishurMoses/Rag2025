OFFICE OF THE PRINCIPAL

Dr. Wilbert M. Schneider
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Wilbert:
Thanks for your letter explaining the foreign language require-
ments at Southern Missionary College. I know full well tha t
this informa tion will cause some of our students to drop their
Spanish, but I believe tha t it will give us a better class of
Spanish students, because those who are taking it will feel more
of an incentive to do a better job. Frankly I wish we could
elemina te foreign language from our curriculum, and then in its
place add other subjects which I feel that the Academy is usually
better qualified to teach. As you know many of our Spanish
teachers are not very well qualified. This makes the language less
acceptable to the students and somet times turns them against being
a linguist.
We shall be glad to have you visit our campus any time that it is
convient with you. Let us know ahead of time and we will be
glad to have you speak at a chapel service or vespers, or even on
Sal bba th. We would apprecia te your visit being on the week-end.
Sincerely yours,
TABlHosu
M. E. Moore
Principal
