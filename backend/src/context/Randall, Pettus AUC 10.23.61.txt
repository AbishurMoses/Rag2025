Mr. H. Pettus Randall, Bditor
Who's Who Among Students in
American Universities and Colleges
P.0. Box 934
Tuscaloosa, Alabama
Dear Mr. Randall:
Several days ago we submitted eight student names for Who's
Who. We had not taken into consideration our nursing group
affiliating at a mental insti tution in Ohio. It has been
our practice to permit the division of nursing faculty to
submit one name from the nursing group for Mho's Who. This
name was submitted belatedly.
We are herewith submitting the name of Edward Sanford Bergholt
to be included with the group formerly submitted making a total
of nine candidates submitted. We hope it is not too late to
submit this name.
Very sin√ßerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
