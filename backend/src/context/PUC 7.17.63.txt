Dean of Students
Pacific Union College
Angwin, California
Dear Dean McCune:
As academic dean, I am not directly in charge of traffic regulations
on campus at Southern Missionary College. In my previous position
as dean of students at Andrews University, I did have charge of this
rather dubious task. I found this to be one of the most difficult areas
to administer in student personnel work.
I have spoken to Mr. West here and asked him what vehicle code is
presently enforced on our campus. He tells me that the only published
material is thatwhichappears in our bulletin. We do have a registration
form that students owning and operating motor vehicles on campus must
fill out. Iam enclosing a copy of that with this letter. I trust this may
beof some help to you.
Since I am not very far removed from the student personnel area, I,
too, am looking forward to getting better acquainted with the dean's
of students at the meeting in Lincoin.
Please give my best regards to Doctors Rittenhouse and Schneider.
I imagine they are working furiously to get ready for the coming
school year.
IfI may be of any further help, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
