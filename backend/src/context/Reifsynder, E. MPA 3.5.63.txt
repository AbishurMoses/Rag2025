Dear Dr. Schneider:
I was happy to receive your letter of February 21
concerning your new entrance requirements and ACT
testing program. We will give our seniors the ACT
tests near the end of the semester.
I would like to know immediately, if possible, whether
you would purchase a supply of these tests as stated
in your letter, and administer this test on our campus
even this year? We have been thinking about such a
program for quite some time.
Sincerely,
A
E, Reifsnyder
