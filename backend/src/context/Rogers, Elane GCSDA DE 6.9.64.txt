ACADEMIC DEANS
Dear Friends:
On June 4, 1964 the General Conference Committee voted to grant
senior college status to Antillian College in the areas of
and education. This 1s not quite the action we had anticipated, theology
and in the next few weeks it may be changed.
Also, the latter part of the month we anticipate Franco-Haitian
Seminary may be upgraded.
For these reasons, we are not sending corrected sheets for the
Status of Overseas Schools at this time, but we will send them at
a later date when the final de√ßision has been made regarding
Antillian College. Perhaps we can include the action concerning
Franco-Hsitian Seminary at that time.
We thought you would like to know at once of the action taken June 4
concerning Antillian College.
Very sincerely yours,
Mrs. Elane B. Rogers
Secretary to E. E. Cossentine
