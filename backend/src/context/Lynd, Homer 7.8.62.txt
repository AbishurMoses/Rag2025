Dear Doctor Lynd:
I am indeed sorry not to have established contact with you
on this campus recently. In fact, I apologize for not being
here but I do hope that you had the opportunity of visiting
with Dr. Rees long enough to learn of our procedure on this
campus.
Yesterday morning, some of our Chilean brethren were on our
campus and I showed them about the college until it was
necessary for them to catch the Greyhound bus in Chattanooga.
We took so mch time on the campus here that we had very
little time left to meet the bus and since they were going to
Madi son to see your college and then on to Washington D. C.
before Sabbath, it was absolutely necessary for them to catch
the bus at that time. We arrived at the station just in time
to dash through and step into the bus that was ready for
departure at that moment. We hope that these fine people from
Chile enjoyed their stay on your campus also.
Again, let me express my sincere regret. in not being here.
This has never happened to me before and I hope it will be
the last time. Perhaps I will have the opportunity of visiting
your campus this fall and at that time we shall have the privi-
lege of discussing mutual problerz pertaining to the social
programs on our individual campuses.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi 1bert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
