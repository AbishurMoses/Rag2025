Dear Friend:
We were delighted to have you visit our campus and to
address the student body at the time of the Senioz
Presentation event. It was an excellent address and many
of the students have commented on the depth of the pre-
sentation with so few words.
Enclosed is the original which you left with us and we
have taken the liberty to mimeograph copies for distri-
bution to our staff. We are also sending you clippings
of our Chattanooga Newspaper.
Come back and see us whenever you have the opportunity to
do so. Ardith joins me in sending warn regards to your
good wife.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
