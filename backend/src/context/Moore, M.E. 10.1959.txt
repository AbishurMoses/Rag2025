Mr. M. B. Moore
Mount Pisgah Academy
Candler, North Carolina
Dear Brother Moore:
Following our telephone commumication earlier today, I have contacted
other responsible members of the administrative staff and have asked
them to cooperate in the plan as suggested regarding students visiting
Mount Pisgah. It will be a real pleasure for us to work with you on
this, for we certainly want to knou where our students are and that
they have made proper arrangements with the school concerned.
we want to know that they behave themselves when they are on other Also,
school campuses.
Incidentally, I am Sure that we shall not have a repetition of the
experience of the fellows who were over there a few weeks ago. As
you probably know, we dealt with them quite summarily, and they were
away. from our campus a few hours after their return. We certainly
didn't waste any time in dealing with them. We just wanted you to
know that we were bitterly disappointed that they should disgrace
themselves; although I suppose the zeal character of these boys
would have come into the light sooner or later in any case.
I think perhaps it would be a good thing for us to establish a
policy regarding students going to visit Mount Pisgah and also any
other school. I imagine we will want to give some attention to this 2
in our President's Council. Dr. Rees is away at the Fa1l Council
at the present time, but we will have the Council this Wednesday,
and I am sure we will want to give this matter some attention on
a wide basis. It would probably be better to have it on a wider
basis than just a particular scbool. Then the students wi1l
realize we are not merely complying with the wishes of one school
but wozking for the better interest of all.
Thanking you for bringing this matter to our attention, I am
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shanke1
