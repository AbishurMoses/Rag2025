Dear College Official:
Last year we prepared a "College-Facts" bulletin containing some
infor-
mation about the general arts colleges of twenty-seven States. A copy pertinent of this bulletin
was sent (without charge) to every high-school principal in these twenty-seven States.
This bulletin was well received by the high-school officials and students we had
hundreds of requests for additional copies. In view of the evident interest in such a
compilation, we are going to get out such a bulletin for the colleges in all
States next year i.e. for all the colleges that we can hear from.
forty-eight
We should like to carry your college in next year's bulletin without
if you would like for us to do SO. I'm enclosing herewith a questionnaire form charge for
your use, if you would like to be included in the brochure. I'm also enclosing here-
with a tear sheet of the bulletin prepared last year, which should give you an idea
of the format and data arrangement.
Please let us have the questionnaire back just as soon as you can. As you can
see, this will be a pretty big undertaking; and we'll have to get the information in
hand by November 1, if your institution is to be included.
We want to get the bulletin mailed to the high schools on or about January
1959. A copy will be sent to every -high school in the United States.
1,
This project is being prosecuted by the National Beta Club (without any cost to
the colleges or high schools) in pursuance of its educational service program.
We hope we may have your early cooperation.
Sincerely,
wHarrig
John W. Harris
Secretary
