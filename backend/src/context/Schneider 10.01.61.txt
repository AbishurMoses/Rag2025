Chattanooga, Tennessee
Dear Mery Beth:
Everytime I think of calling you in regard to your request
to secure the services of practice teachers for the Chattanooga
Church School, it is during a period when you are pexhaps
teaching school. I am, therefore, going to commumicate with
you by letter hoping that I will be able to explain the
situation more fully.
In talking with Doctor Kennedy regarding your problem, I
have leared that the needs of our students can be met on
our campus with some getting in their practice teaching hours
at the Apison and Ooltewah schools. Doctor Kennedy feels that
the students wouid not be too anxious to go to Chattancoga
because of the comuting distance which takes away nuch of
their precious tine. Sone have complained about going to
Ooltewah and Apison. Our students seen to be on a very tight
schedu le and if they are going to get in theiz work time as
well as their study time, perhaps it would be asking too puch
of them to commte to Chattanooga every day.
We wish it were possible to give you some assistance but it
seems best at this time that t we decline your gracious invitation.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
AÃ§ademic Dean
