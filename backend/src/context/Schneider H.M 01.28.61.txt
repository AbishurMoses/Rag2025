Dear Brother Stonebrook:
We appreciate your inquiry regarding conducted. field programs
during the sumer period. We are happy to tell you that
Southern Missionary College will be sponsoring two programs
next summes r that may be of interest to you.
The college is sponsoring a tour through the southland and
will be giving credit in History of the South. This tour will
start from the campus of Southern Missionary College and the
student will be able to earn approximately three semester hours
of credit. Following the tour the student can earn additional
hours of credit on our campus.
We are also organizing another Language Field School in Spanish.
This group wi1l be heading for Mexico where they will spend
approximately six weeks on the campus at Montemorelos and two
weeks in traveling all the way down to Mexico City. Miss Westphal
will conduct this tour and it may be organized in conjunction with
the Pacific Union College Language School. The student should be
able to earn from six to eight hours of credit in Spanish. We
conducted-such a Language Field School last summer and it was a
great success. Students from your area could meet us somewhere
in Texas or down in the vai 1ley-
Under separate cover we are mailing you one of ouE college
bulletins for the school year 1961-62. We hope this will be of
interest to you and should you desire further information regarding
the summer field schools, we shall be haj PPy to hear from you again.
Our summer school brochure will not be out until sometime the later
part of February, but we hope that there will be a large number
interested in both of our field schools.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
