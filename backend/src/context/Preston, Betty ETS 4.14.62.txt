Dear Colleague :
We have received & request from Dr. John L. Holland for data on the
American Council on Education Psychological Examination for College Stu-
dents, to be used in studies which he is conducting as Director of
Research for the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.
Dr. Holland is interested in mean scores of students who entered
college between 1946 and 1952. Our records include data for some or
all of those years for your college, and we should like to be able to
make them available to Dr. Holland. However, we certainly will not do
sO without your written permission; we realize that you allowed us to
collect and retain the data with the understanding that. they would be
held in confidence.
Dr. Holland assures that no publication which links name of col-
lege with data will be made; he understands entirely the ne√®d for
anonymity, and as a precaution will haverus examine his reports before
they are published to make sure that it is preserved.
If you would be willing, under these circumstances, to have us
release your mean scores to Dr. Holland, will you be sO good as to let
me know by May 1?
Let me thank you in advance for any help you can give us.
Very sincerely yours,
replow Rud Brau
