Dear Elder Schneider:
I have just received your placement brochure for the seniors of 1963.
We are in need of someone to teach physics I chemis try and mathe-
matics here for the coming year.
I noticed in your letter that you recommended very highly Mr. Bill
Mundy, and S o took the liberty to call him yes terday but discovered
that he has taken a pos ition with Southern Miss ionary College on
the college teaching staff there for next year. He gave me the name
of Bob McCurdy, and I also called him last evening and talked to
him for S ome time. He, however, does not have a chemis try minor
but has only eight hours in it. I wonder if you would have a folder
on him, giving any further qualifications that he might have as far
as his hours of education and practice teaching, and whether or
not he has the right cours es for State certification.
I would als O like to know how you would recommend him as a pos -
sible teacher on the secondary level. If you feel that he has
prospects of being a good potential teacher, we might consider
taking him and either S ending him to summer S chool and finis hing
up seven hours of chemis try sO that he would have a minor, or
otherwise re-arranging our schedule here S o that our present
chemistry teacher would continue with chemis try and Mr. McCurdy
could take more of the mathematics.
Any information regarding him would be appreciated very much.
Sincerely yours I
Herluf L. Jense en
