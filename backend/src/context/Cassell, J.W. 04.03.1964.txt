Dear Jack:
Through Sharlene Nelson I was able to get the
address for Donice Polk: 11082 Richmont, Loma following
California. Sharlene hasn 't heard from this girl Linda, since
Christmas but this was her address at that time. No
one else seems to have information concerning her where-
abouts.
I called the public relations office about a guest room
for you for the night of April 22. Gene says she is
afraid the new rooms will be taken by those here for the
MV Officers Seminar and the Intercollegiate Workshop but
that she will try to have something for you. If
are more than welcome to stay at our place. Let not, us you
