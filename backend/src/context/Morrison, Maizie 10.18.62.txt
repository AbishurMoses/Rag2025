Dear Miss Morrison:
Perhaps you are so1 mewhat confused regarding the information
which you received from a Miss Bertha B. Parker, Associate
Director of the School of Nursing at the Paxadise Valley
Sanitarium and Hospital, 2575 East 8th Street, National
Cal lifornia. We are not acquainted with MissParkerrand City, we do
not know how well prepared you are to start the nuxsing program.
It would not be possible for us to have you study nursing in
Jamaica as part of our nursing program. Students who are taking
nursing with us must be on our campus for several years and then
they transfex to our Orlando Sanitarium and Hospital in Plorida,
after which they return to our campus for their senior year. The
program here is a collegiate program which I don't think you wou 1d
be interested in. It would require all of four years to
after the student has finished the four years of high Schoo1 complete work.
I seriously doubt that it would be possible for you to take the
collegiate program.
Perhaps we should refer you to the Andrews Memorial Hospital,
27 Hope Road, Kingston 10, Jamaica. If it were possible for
you to counsel with some of the nurses on the staff or with
Doctor H. R. Rittenhouse, one of the staff physicians, it may
be you could come up with an idea of what you should do. As of
now, we could not encourage you to take our collegiate school of
nursing. It is a very difficult program and unless you were able
to use the English language with ski1l, it would be virtually
impossible for you to master the subject matter. Also we do not
know whether you have completed the high school program in
or not. I would suggest that you counsel with one of the medical Jamaica
people at the Andrews Memorial Hospital. Sorry we are unable to
assist you at this time.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
