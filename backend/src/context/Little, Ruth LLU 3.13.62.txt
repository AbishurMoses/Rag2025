Dear Dean Schneider:
Your letter inquiring regarding Miss Fowler's acceptance to the
dietetic internship was received today.
Since the Ameri can Dietetic Association expects that appointment ts
for all internships be made at the same time on April 15 and
since we receive appli cations until the first of March, we usually
do not check the appli ca tion material until after that date.
I believe that Miss Fowler received a School of Dietetic brochure
whi ch we send all students who apply. On page 16 of this brochure
there is the following statement. "The applicant's data should
be received by the School not later than March 1, since appointments
are made before April 15 by admission during the current year. 1
Last week when we checked Miss Fowler's appli ca tion material we
found that she is lacking three items - her trans cript and medi cal
and dental forms. A letter has been wri tten to her regarding this.
Thank you for writing me. I trust that this will explain the
difficulty. Under separate cover I am sending you one of out
School of Dieteti CS Brochures as well as a set of the application
forms.
Very sincerely yours,
PcrEl dck
