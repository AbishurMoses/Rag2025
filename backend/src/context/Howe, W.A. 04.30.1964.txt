Dear Doctor Howe:
I have carefully looked over the first draft of the report of the
Evaluation Committee for the Bass Memorial Academy. Ihave no
suggestions to offer for improvement or correction of the
as
it stands presently. Ibelieve the report very accurately outlines report the
program at Bass.
Again let me say how much I appreciate working with you and the other
members of the committee. The experience was very valuable to me
personally as it has been my desire to get better acquainted with the
academy programs in the Southern Union. This gave me a very
excellent opportunity to do this and helped me to gain considerable
insight of the program at Bass Memorial Academy.
May I take this opportunity to wish you the Lord's richest blessings
as you continue to carry the heavy responsibilities of your office.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
