Dear Doctor Pettit:
Thank you for the brochure which you sent to us representing
promotional material in behalf of osteopathy- One of our
better students has already been accepted for next year's
class. He will be going to Kansas City where he has a
brother already enrolled. It is entirely possible that a
second student will be going there also. We feel that they
receive an excellent training at the Kansas City School and
we do not hesitate to recommend it. Thank you again for
your interest.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schnelder
Academic Dean
