Dear Mr. Johnson:
We appreciate your inquiry in regard to the possibility of
completing your requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree
on our campus. Thus far we have not yet received the trans-

the amount of work which you will need to take next year in
order to complete your program.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
