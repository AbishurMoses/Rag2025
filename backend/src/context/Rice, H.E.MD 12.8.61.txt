Dear Bzother Rice;
We would be pleased to receive any matérials prepared on
Administrative and Accounting Procedures regarding our
hospitals. These materiei can be used to good advantage
and the course which students may take to delve into any
problems of this nature.
Inasmuch as I was once associat ted with White Memorial
Hospital, I am personally very much interested in any
new accounting procedures which may have been developed
since that date.
Very sincerely yours,
Wiibert M. Schneider
