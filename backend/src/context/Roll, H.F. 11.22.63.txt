Dear Brother Roll:
I had int√®nded to talk with you personally concerning the application of
Miss Cille Puckett for work as a secretary in your office when we were
in Miami. Due to the fact that I was under the weather while in Miami,
I did not have the opportunity to do many of the things I had intended to do.
We did not re-accept Miss Puckett as a student at Southern Missionary
College this fall because we have some very serious question concerning
her relationship with another student here last year. There is strong
indication that she and this girl were engaged in a questionable type of
relationship. Consequently, we felt that the two giris should be separated
and decided to re-accept the other girl and not accept Miss Puckett for this
school year. We made this decision primarily on the basis that we felt
Miss Puckett was primarily the aggressor in the relationship. The other
girl, however, has now dropped out of school and there is some possibility
that we will accept Miss Puckett for the second semester.
She is a very capable and intelligent girl and if she can satisfactorily
work out this psychological problem, I believe she would not only be a
good worker, but can eventually make a contribution to our work. As
the resultoof these problems, here, however, I would be rather reluctant
to give her a high recommendation for work in the conference at this
time. If we should re-accept her and she shows that she now has con-
trol over this problem, I woutd not hesitate to recommend her in the
future.
I trust you will keep this information confidential as it is not widely
known. Ialso would not want Miss Puckett to know that this information
had been shared with you because of the nsture of the problem. If I can
be of any fuxther assistance, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
