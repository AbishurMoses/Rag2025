Dear Dean Stratton:
suot visison1a
I must apologize for not getting the information you asled for in your
letter of April 7 to you sooner, but with College Days and numerous
other activities, I have not been able to compile it until now. I believe
the following information will answeryour qu√©stions adequately.
nasa pimobsoA
1964-65 - 553 Bulletins - $599.90 - 116 pages plus cover
1963-64 - 501 Bulletins - $395.40 - 84 pages plus cover
1962-63 - 473 Bulletins - $366.00 - 96 pages plus cover
In regard to question 3, Ifeel that these booklets are very valuable
in placing our students. I realize they are costly, but it seems to me
that if we are able to place one or two students, the cost is probably
justified. I question whether a mimeographed brochure would do the
job as well since many potential employers are quite interested in a
picture of the individual. It seems to me that with our desize as
denominational schools to see our young people placed in our work, it
is necessary for us to present our graduates to the field in a rather
attractive manner.
All df this may just be supposition on my part, but I believe I am
correct. There is a tendency that I think is unfortunapefor our schools
to try to out do each other on this type of material. This I think is
unnecessary and wasteful. What many of us suggested at the admini-
strators meeting at Union two years ago was that the General Conference
set up a placement office from which they could disseminate this type of
information from a centralized office. If this were done, the cost to
each college would be considerably less than it is at the present.

Of courseour recominendation there was more in terms of graduate
students but it could apply to both. Certainly I have no empirical
evidence that a printed brochure is better than a mimeographed one,
but the above ramblings may be of some value to you in compilinge.a nobIa.M
information you are seeking.  think it would be of interest if astudynu sidmloo
of this were made by some placement officer in one of our collegesv es amoloT
I will appreciate receiving the material after you have summarized it.

Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Sir:
This is an inquiry of evaluation in which we request you
to answer the following three items to the best of your
ability:
1. The number of placement booklets printed each
year for the last three years.
2. The cost per booklet or total cost each year.
3. How you evaluate the booklets in placing students.
(Do you feel a mimeographed brochure would do the
job as satisf factorily?)
Upon receipt of the material from all our colleges we will
be happy to summarize and send back a report on the find-
ings. If you have any suggestions in terms of evaluation we
shall be happy to hear from you.
Sincerely your s,
Shm -
