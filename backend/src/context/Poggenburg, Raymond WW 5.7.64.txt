Dear Doctor Poggenburg:
I understand that the campus representative for the Woodrow Wilson
Foundation is provided with a certaln amount of money for use in
promoting the Woodrow Wilson program on this campus.
Last fall I had a letter from you asking if we needed an additional
appropriation. At that time we did have adequate funds in our treasury
and did not feel that we needed any more. However, we have spent all
of our funds now in promoting the program and would lke to request
that we be considered for an additional appropriation.
I would appreciate your consideration of this request and 1 would also
like to have further information in terms of just how to apply for these
funds and how they are allocated. Any information you could give me
would be greatly appreciated.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
