Dear Mr. Shepherd: 0o 03 5902 lool sasslq ot ad sousialess V To ed Yan I -
On April 22 the Educational - : Board voted VV that the academies in the
Southern Union Conference would participate in the ACT program.
In fact, Southern Missionary College has now made this tests airequire-
ment for admission for the 1964-65.academic year. It was recommended
at the Educational Board meeting that these tests be given in the fall of
the year. After talking with Doctor R. F. Thomason, the ACT repre-
sentative for the South East, it was decided that each academy would
be recognized by the ACT program as a testing center.

Consequently I would like for you to designate one individual on your
campus as the ACT contact representative. This individual would be
responsible for giving the tests and returning them to ACT for scoring.
Complete instructions for administering the tests are included. They
are relatively simple to administer and any teacher who has given
standardized tests previously should have no trouble administering
these tests. This way it will save the college considerable expense
and should be even more effective. There is frequently a negative
psychological factor introduced when someone outside of the academy
comes in to give tests.
As you know, the cost of the test is to be paid by the student. The fee
is $4. We hope that you will require this test of all your seniors even
though some of them think they are going out of the union to school and
will not ineed to take the test. It appears that most of our colleges are
now going on the ACT program. Consequently it may become a nation
wide requirement very shortly.
I hope it will be possible for you to forward the name of the individual
who will serve as the ACT contact person on your campus to me as
soon as possible. I want to get all of this information to Doctor Thomason
before the end of the summer so details may be sent to this individual

prior to the November test date, K you do not feel that you would Mke
to delegate this responsiblity to a teacher, you could serve as the
contact person for your school.
I am looking forward totthe opportunity of working with you in the
education of the young men and women of the Southern Union. I
believe we must work very closely together since good articulation
asnl.TM
between academy and college is vitally important to the w√®lfare and
 T93nenD
success of our students. I trust it will be possible for us to meet

personally in the very near future.
