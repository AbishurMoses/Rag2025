La Sierra, Californin
Dear Mrs. Suhrie:
We are happy to be able to send these pictures along with this
letter to you. No doubt, you wi1l be interested to Tmnow about the
discovery of these pictures and why we are able to send then to you
at this time. There have been many searches for then, let me assure
you!
Last year, when working with the Student Association, I looked
all through our files there to see if we could find these pictures,
for Mrs. Dean had told us that you were very amcious to find then.
Since I Was also working for the Public Re lations Department at
that time, wo made it a point to look thrgh our picture files
there, aiso, but to no avail. Recently wen Mr. H. H. Kuhlman
returned from Californin, he asked about the pictures of Doctor
Suhrie which vere never returned to you.
This moring, Mrs. Jane Broum, the president's secretary, and
I began looking for these pictures again, and she found then in
the files of the Public Relations Department. Obviously, either
the Southern Accent or the Southern Memories had found these
pictures in their files this sumer and I fnally sent them to the
proper place.
Although the delay is indeed regrettable, we rejoice with you
that these pictures are once again in your possession, and we can
see what value they are to you. Even though I never personally
met either you OE Doctor Suhrie, everyone who lew you or hin has
certainly given a wozd of praise for the service rendered this
college through your dedication.
Very sincerely yours,
Jolena Taylor
