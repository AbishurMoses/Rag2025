Candler, North Carolina
Dear Brother Reifsnyder:
Iwould like to express our appreciation for the opportunity of meeting
with your faculty and seniors this week. Mr. Futcher and I felt that
this was a very profitable experience for us and we trust that we were
able to bring something of value to these gzoups.
Personally I am very favorably impreased with your faculty and senior
class. I believe you have a very dedicated faculty who are dedicated
to the education of the young people of the Carolina Conference. I
also sense a good working relationship df the faculty and the administration.
This, I believe, is vitally important in the creation of a good education
environment.
Please express our appreclations to the dean of women for her hospitality
and to your wife for the very delicious breakfast she served to on
Wednesday morning.
If we may be of any further service to you, please feel free to call on
us.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
