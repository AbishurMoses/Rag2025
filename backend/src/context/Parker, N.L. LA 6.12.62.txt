Mr. N. L. Parker, Principal
Lynwood Academy
11081 Harris Avenue
Lynwood, California
Dear Mr. Parker:
Miss Ruth Lutz has requested that a placement folder be mailed
to you concerning her. We presume that you lodged this request
with Miss Lutz.
We regret that Southern Missionary College has not followed the
procedure of producing placement folders for its seniors. I had
hoped to prepare such a folder for the seniors this year but
time did not permit because of our self-study program in which
we were engaged for the Southern Association. Perhaps it will
be possible for me to make up such a placement folder in the
future.
If there is any specific information you wish concerning this
young lady, we shall be pleased to hear from you again. Miss
Lutz has been a fine Christian lady and because of her Latin
American background, she should be able to teach Spanish with-
out any problem. The young people wi1l appreciate her ability
to converse in Spanish. She has somewhat of a German heritage
and with a little additional work, she should be able to teach
German also. Miss Lutz has a lot of drive and is a hard worker.
Someone has expressed the idea that she should have no probiem
of maintaining discipline in a classroom. She is a little lady
but should be able to supervise the students without too msch
of a problem. We sincerely hope that she does well for you.
If we can assist you in any other way, please let us hear from
you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
