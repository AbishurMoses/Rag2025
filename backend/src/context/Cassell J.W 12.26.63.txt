I must apologize for not answering your letter of December 1 sooner
but the rush of vacation activities has directed my attention to numerous
other matters. Iam glad that Robin was able to return to the campus satis-
IASY
factorily following the Thanksgiving vacation. I trust he has had a very
pleasant Christmas vacation with you and the other members of his family.
We can understand problems involved in travel and we are usually willing
to make concessions where it is absolutely necessary. However, we do expect
our students to make every effort to arrive on campus at the proper time in
order to meet their class and chapel appointments.
fsaaso
In regard to chapel exercises, I'can only say that we maintain our
chapel program in our schools because we believe they do have a molding
influence on our student body. In fact, as you probably know, the dropping of
compulsory chapel from the program of many church-related colleges is only
the beginning of the trend toward secularism. Consequently, we feel that this
is a unique and important part of a church-related college program. We,
therefore, want to keep it within the program and do all that we can to strengthen
our chapels and make them as interesting and stimulating to our student body
as possible.
It is true that the faculty is not required to attend chapel. Many of them
do, however, and we do try to encourage them to come as often as possible.
Most of us question the advisability of requiring mature professional people
to attend chapels. We believe that this decision for the faculty must be an
individual and personal one.
We do emphasize, however, the importanceeof student attendance at
chapel and have put into operation some rather severe disciplinary measures

for those who do not wish to comply. However, even in this we try to be
flexible and to work with each individual case up to a certain point. When
a student is chronically absent from chapel, however, we do have to take rather
severe, drastic measures. I don't anticipate reaching this point in Robin's
case. He reçognizes the importance of chapel attendance and will make sure
that he is up in the morning and on time to meet this appointment.
we will do all we can to work with him and he knows it is possible for Certainly him to
be excused from chapel if he is 111 or is called home on an emergency.ar haa 7a
Othèrwise, we expect attendance at all chapels except for the two skips he waok
has per semester.
