Mr. Gordon Conde Osgood
354 Milford Square Road
Quakertown, Pennsylvania
Dear Brother Osgood:
We were pleased to receive your letter in regard to your two
daughters, Cei lest and Se1 lah. We wish both were ready for
college but of course those things just don't work out. We
are enclosing a college application blank and also one for the
academy if Se lah is interested in coming to this campus.
We wish we could respond favorably in terms of permitting Selah
to live with Celest in the. college dormitory. Our ladies home
for the college girls will be more than filled for next year and
it would hardly be fair to ask a lady of college age to wait a
year of so before coming to college. We would be glad to receive
Célest's application blank and if Selah is interested in coming
to this campus, it may be that the academy faculty would accept
her on condition that she live with the few academy dormitory
students we have which are housed in the up stairs of the academy
building. This is not the most ideal arrangement and of course
we are not encouraging dormitory academy students to come to this
campus. In fact, after the Georgia-Omberland Academy is built
we hope to run our academy entirely as a day school. As it is,
we wi1l have approximately 26 oE 27 academy giris living in the
up stairs area of the academy building. This is an area of
course that has been occupied by academy dormitory students
and prior to that by married couples as we1l as staff members.
We are very sorry that it would not be possible for Célest and
Se lah to room together, but of course they could see each other
often on the campus.
In anot ther year we hope to have an additional wing added to the
present new ladies dormitory and this will make it possible for
us to house approximately 400 girls. The pressure of enrollment
is on us and we are doing everything possible to take worthy
students.
