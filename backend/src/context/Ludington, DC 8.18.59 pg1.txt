Dear Brother Ludington:
We have Just returned to Collegedale after the very
pleasant sumer spent mostly on the West Coast.
We were very happy to see the new blacktop road around
the house. This will be a real pleasure I an sure.
According to your suggestion I have taken the iberty
of charging the telephone call to your account, also
the electric charge for the month of June 15 to Juiy 15
since we were not here anytime during those dates, and
also part of the water biil. I have asked the business
office to place these as charges on your account. I
trust that this wi1l be in order.
We will appreciate having the heaters all fixed up again,
too, and hope that everything will be in order for the
coming school year.
With very kindest regards, I an
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankei
Jr
