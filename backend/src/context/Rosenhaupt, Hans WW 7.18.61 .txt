Dear Mz. Rosenbaupt:
This is to report on the status of the expense allowance for
the past year.
It is ous practice to set up a Woodrow WIson zeserve account,
out of which we drat to meet the expenses of promoting the
work of the foundation on this campus. We had a carry-over
from years before in the amount of $50. When adding the $25
sent to uS last year, it gave us a total of $75 to work on.
The sum of $65 has been expended leaving a balance of $10 in
the fund. It is our plan to call together all of our depart-
ment heads this fail to disseminate information in regard to
the Woodzow Wilson Foundation. Funds will be used to serve
refreshments oz whatever is necessary to male the occasion
complete. We find a good interest on our campus, but we are
sorry that no students were named last year as recipients
for your aard. Several of our students, I am sure, would
have qualified inasmuch as they achieved an enviable record
on the Graduate Record Bxamination and have since received
fellowships and scholerships from other sources to assist
them in their graduate programs. One of them xeceived a
National Science Award and will be going to Stanford University
andaanother wi1l be going to Florida University under a grant.
We hope that we wi1l be more successful this next year.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schne ider
