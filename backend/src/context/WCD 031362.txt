Mr. William C. Dupper
2181 Doris Drive
Decatur, Georgia
Dear Bill:
Your recent letter poses a serious problem in terms of your
desire to enter college here with the thought of completing
a program leading to a degree in teacher education. Inas-
much as you did not achieve a "C" average in your work at
Atlantic Union College, it would hardly be possible for us
to accept you as a student on this campus.
Our general policy requires that students achieve at least a
"c" average prior to their junior year of college. Also it
would not be possible for you to be admitted into the teacher
training program for your work in student Teaching and Obser-
vation wi thout having achieved a 1.25 average in the professional
courses as well as in the content fields.
Because of these problems, I would comnsel you to go slowly in
planning your future. First of all our Admissions Committee
would need to receive an application blank, a transcript, and
two or three references from people that have nown you in
recent years as far as your work is concerned and of course
your church affiliation. I have no doubt as to the later.
We are enclosing an application blank and this wi1l take a
while to process. To speed up the processing of this appli-
cation, you could of course have A.U.C. mail the admissions
office a transcript of your work there and also have certain
individuals who are in a position to know you in Ati lanta send
in their recommendation by letter.
The above may appear somewhat discouraging but we want to be very
fair with you. It would be folly for us to encourage you inas-
much as we are acquainted with the hurtles which would have to
be crossed and these would be very difficult for you because of
the scholastic record which you have already written. We would
rather be frank at this time than to disappoint you in the future.
Very Sincerely yours,
Wi lbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
