Hinsdale, Illinois
Dear Brother Oswald:
Thank you very much for the complimentary copy of the book entitled
"His Name Was David." Since this man had a great influence on the
medical work as it began, I shall be most interested in reading this
book. Iam sure that the members of the faculty will also appreciate
reading it. I am reminded that Doctor Paulson was very influential
in the work at the White Memorial following his efforts to establish
the Hinsdale Sanitarium and Hospital.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
