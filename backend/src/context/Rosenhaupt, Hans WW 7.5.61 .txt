Memorandum to Campus Representatives
From Hans Rosenhaupt
We are now preparing the expense allowance
checks for the academic year 1961-1962.
In order to send your check soon we need
a brief accounting of your expenses during the past
year showing the unexpended balance.
Will you be good enough to let us have this
information as soon as possible?
Thank you.
