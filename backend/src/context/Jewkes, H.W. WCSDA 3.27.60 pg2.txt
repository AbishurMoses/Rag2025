Dear Brother Jewkes:
Thank you for your letter of March 23 concerning Robert Kriigel. I
have talked to him recently and it is tgue that he would like to
teach in Wisconsin rather than here in the south. I know we would
have no difficulty In ptcing hin down here. Eider Hanson, the
Educational Secretary, was talking to me just a couple days ago
about Mr. Kriigel for a school in Florida.
I am able to speal well of Mr. Kriigel and believe he would do
we1l with the seventh and eigbth grades or something of that kind,
or as principal of a large elementary school. He came from the
north and is interested in his own hgne state. He has produced
very good work here and is a mature man with a very good bearing
and dignity- I think he would exercise very fine control over a
school. He is not umkind, however. but he would be Firn. We have
enjoyed his association here and regard him highiy.
The Southern Union is interested in hin for a multi-room elementary
school in whfch he would teach grades seven and eight, but they
have not made any definite contact with him.
The information given in the leaflet sent out to various parts of
the field indicates that his minor is in Biology and is receiving
both denominational and state certification. He is 35 years of
age, but has five children which of course is quite a financial
obligation, However, he bas a home here So he is not poverty
stricken, but he would have to dispose of his home here before going
north. His wife is a nurse so they manage quite well financially.
I can only speak of hin in favorable terms and I think you ould not
go wrong, especially if he were placed with seventh and eighth grades
or even higher grades in academy.
Very kindest regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
