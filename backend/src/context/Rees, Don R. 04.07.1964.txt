Dear Brethren,
The luncheon for the Plorida Gonference for the GOMMITTEE OF 100
will be held on April 23 in the main dining room at the Grest:
Restaurant, 5133 West Golonial Drive, Orlando. The time is set:
for 12:30 noon.
Let me assure you again that it means a great deal for the ladies
to join us for these occasions. It is a Fellowship these foll
will long remember. At this meeting the ladies will leave after
the luncheon to tour the new facilities at the Plorida Hospital
and Sanitarium, Mrs. Hanhardt is to give a grapho-mnalysis
program in one of the lomges there. We fecl this will be
interesting and enjoyable for them.
You will note that the reservations are to be sent to Brother Iles
so that he will know how many to make final arrangements for on
the luncheon.
Suggestions on this progran at any time wi1l surely be appreciated.
Sincerely,
Oscar L, Heinrich, Chairman
