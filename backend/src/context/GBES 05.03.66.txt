It was nice hearing from you again. I appreciate your greeting for
Janet and Johmy. They are doing well in school this year and seem
to be enjoying themselves. They are looking forward to the summer
with more free time, a vacation trip and other activities we are now
planning.
I am enclosing a statement "To Whom It May Concern" regardi ng
your employment at Southern Missionary College. I trust this will
be satisfactory to you.
