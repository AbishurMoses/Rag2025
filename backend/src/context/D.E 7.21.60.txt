Dear Brother Mathews:
Your letter to DE. Shankel in regard to the new Teacher 's
Guide for a course in school health was zeferred to me inasnuch as
I an Dean Shankel's successor here at Southern Missionary
College. You may zecall I served in this sane capacity at EMC
before going to California.
Your preparation of a Teacher's Guide for a course in
School Health is very much appreciated. We do have a health
pr inciples cdasse in our curriculun and I would be delighted
to receive a copy of the Teacher"s Guide for our perusal.
If you will mail these complimentary copies to my office,
I shall see that our instructors receive then before the
beginning of the new school year.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
