Dear Norvail:
We wish to thank you for the service rendered on our campus
in delivering one of the finest commencement addresses I have
listened to. Ne have had much comment pertaining to the
address and we simply want to say thank you.
Whenever you find tine, we would be pleased to have you mail
us a copy of the address in order that we may reproduce it
for certain members of our staff and senior class that have
requested copies.
Thanks again for coming to our campus and I hope it will be
our pleasure to have you back here again when you can stay
longer.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
