Dear Dr. Rees:
Dr. Carmichael and I have for some time been interested in a project
which we feel has great merit and we have decided to call this
Greater Chattanooga Youth Seminars.
The venture is proposed to provide organized but yet informal learning
opportunities for youth who are reaching out for stimulating and
challenging experiences which they ar e not gaining in the highly struc -
ture ed school situation. These will operate at a very high level with
real depth generally rèquiring maturity of senior high and superior
junior high school students.
Prese ently we have only had one meeting at which time we had repre esen-
tatives from the Hamilton County schools and the City schools, including
the superintendents and a member of each board of education, members
from the thre ee Councils of Parent Teacher Associations, and Citizens
Committee for Better Schools. We will us e other people in working with
these S eminars and we proposed at our first and only meeting that it
would be well to invite you to participate in these seminars through the
selection of S ome outstanding students. In doing this we would like for
you to select one pers son from your staff to work with Dr. Elizabeth
Dalton from the City Schools and Mr. E. L. Fitch from the County
Schools along with guidance personnel from both systems and the princi-
pals of our respective high schools.
W e consider this a very worthwhile ventur e and trust that you will find
it possible to join us.
Sincerely your s,
y
Sam P. McConnell
Superintendent,
Hamilton County Schools
