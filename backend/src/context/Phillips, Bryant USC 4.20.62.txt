Dear Doctor Phillips:
Thank you sincerely for the invitation extended to join you
on May 11 at the time of the next Order of Artus meeting.
It would be a deligbtful experience to meet with all of you
again but distance at this time does not permit. Perhaps in
the future a space capsule may be available for such purposes.
It is a pleasure and honor to submit a brief statement as a
member of Artus of commendation in behalf of Doctor Clyde
Pheips at the time of his retirement frou active teaching.
No ssudent who has ever taken class work under Doctor Pheips
can deny the severity of academic discipline applied. Although
the subject matter was important and interesting, neverthe less
the greatest lesson learned and experienced ga ined involved
the discipline of the mind. From a personal point of view
this has been my greatest asset in my present work as academic
dean, It was kind of him to deve lop ha rdness.
Wish I could be with you but this is impossible. Nevertheless
I an anxious to convey greetings to ali of you such as Doctor
William Anderson, Doctor Garis, and of course Doctor Phelps.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi Ibert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
