Dear Mr. Rockle:
I have referred your letter of the 14th regarding your questions
concerning the possibility of applying your nursing credits toward
a pre-med course at Southern Missionary College to our director
of admissions, Mr. Cyril Futcher. I believe he would be in a
better position to answer your question since they primarily
involve admission to the college.
I am very happy to learn of your interest in Southern Missionary
College and I am sure you will be hearing from Mr. Futcher in
the near future. I imagine, however, that he will have to have a
copy of your transcript before he would be able to give you a
definite answer to your questions. .
IfI may be of any further service to you, please feel free to contact
me.
Very sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
