Dear Dean Shankel:
We appreciate your letter of April 22, explaining Mr. Showalter's
difficulties in being behind with his semester hour credits due
to extra curricula activities.
While we are in sympathy with his problems we wish to advise that
he was aware that we could only help him eight semesters, and we are
not permitted to help him beyond this school year. We do hope he
will be able to work out some other arrangements to complete his
education.
Yours very truly,
