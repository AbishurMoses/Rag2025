Mr. Ronald Numbers
Talge Hall
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Numbers:
Dr. Schilling has expressed much appreciation for the change
of dates. He will be with us on May 6 and 7. We ought to
keep these dates in mind for purposes of advertising.
Perhaps you will want to start advertising the Popham lecture
any day now in order to secure 3 full house.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi Ibert M. Schneider
AÃ§ademic Dean
