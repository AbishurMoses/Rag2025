Mr. W. M. Schneider
Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College
Oollegedale, Tenn.
Dear Dean Schneider:
I want to thank you for being so kind and sending a letter
of recommendation to Newbold Missionary College for me.
I had requested this of Dr. Kennedy because of the fact
that I had been told that he was to take your place for the
summer. However, it seems that my source of information was
wrong.
As yet I don not know whether I will be going to NMO
this coming year for I have not received a letter of acdeptance
thus far. If I was too late in making my application to the
school I will then continue to attend SMC.
Again I want to thank you,
Sincerely,
Arn√©ld J. Media
