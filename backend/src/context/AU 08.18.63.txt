Mr. Dyre Dyresen, Registrar
a
Andrews University
Berrien Springs, Michigan
Dear Dyre:
I always appreciated the good organization you have promoted in the
Registrar's Office at Andrews. I especlally liked the little face sheet
that you were using on the admission folder. I believe you included
the student's grade point average, religion, basic units, and other
pertinent information. I thought this was an excellent way of condensing
all this information on to one sheet. I wish you would send a copy of
this form to me along with other forms that you are currently using
there.
Brother Futcher is doing an excellent job as registrar but I would
like to streamline the method of presenting these names to the
Admissions Committee. It seems to me that we spend too much time
here leafing through the folder looking for vital statistics.
It was good to talk with you briefly at Union and at Berrien. We miss
all of our many friends at Berrien Springs but really feel very much
at home here now. We had a good trip back from Union and now find
ourselves in full swing in getting ready for the coming school year.
Best wishes to you.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
