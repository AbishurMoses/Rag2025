Dear Doctor Schneider:
You will find enclosed the manuscript I promised to send you of my
commencement address. I am sorry I could not re turn it to you
immediately, but it took a little time to edit it and get it pre-
pared for mailing. This is the only copy of the revised manuscript
that I have, and I am wondering if you would share it or a copy that
you may make with Doct tor Rees. He asked for a copy of the address.
I want you to know how much I enjoyed my visit on your campus. .
Everyone was very pleasant and hospitable. We especially enjoyed
the excellent food and good fellowship at your house on Sunday
noon. It was a real pleasure to renew acquaintance with you folk
again.
At the present moment, I am spending my days and nights st tudying for
my doctoral language examination in French which is scheduled for
next Monday. I will be spending the first part of the summer at
Michigan State and will renew my program there next fall.
May I wish you much success as you continue your work at Southern
Missionary College. It is obvious that your school is making rapid
progress.
Very cordially yours,
