Mr. N. L. Parker, Principal
Lynwood Academy
11081 Harris Avenue
Lynwood, California
Dear Mr. Parker:
We appreciate very much your interest in securing the
services of Judy Fowler as an English teacher during the
second semester of this school year.
I had the opportunity of visiting with Judy this morning and
she has indicated a great deal of interest in this proposition
and she also informed me that she had not taken the offer
presented by Principal Howlett of Sandia View Academy. This
of course clears the way for you to secure her services if all
works out to the satisfaction of both of you.
Judy is definitely interested in going to California and since
she is very well acquainted with Miss Lutz and also m√®mbers
of the Orangewood Academy, I don't believe it would be too
difficult for you to secure her services.
We will recommend Judy very highly and you will not be
disappointed in having Judy on your staff. When it comes to
singing, she will also serve you well. The students will like
her and she will do a good job in her teaching.
Should you have any further guestions, please let me hear
from you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
