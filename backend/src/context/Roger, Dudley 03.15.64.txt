Mr. Roger L. Dudley
Superintendent of Education
2160 Brunswick Avenue
Trenton 8, New Jersey
Dear Mr. Dudley:
I appreciate your interest in our 1964 graduates. All of our elementary
education majors are now placed or under some type of scholarship
commitment to one of the conferences. It seems that we are never able
to graduate enough elementary teachers. Iwish it were possible for me
to send you a list of several people that would be available.
If you should have any further interest in someone majoring in some
other field, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Ir.
Academic Dean
