Mr. Don Dees
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Dees:
I have discussed the problem of dormitory competition with seyeral
members df the Finance Committee. We are, of course, all aware of
the fact that the practice of cutting hair in the residence halls has been
going on ever since there has been a college. It is difficult to stop this
activity completely, aithough our dean of men has repeatedlyspoken to
fellows that have been involved.
We are again requesting our: dean of men to contact the names of
individuals given me by letter. Mr. Davis, our dean of men, will do
this in the next few days. We have stressed the illegality of it and have
asked for their cooperation. By and large most of the fellows are
cooperating.
I fear that there is a much greater problem involved than may be seen
on the surface. We have been told by some of our young men that they
simply will not return for your service because of the nature of the hair
cut given. There seems to be some dissatisfaction and this, of course,
militates against the building up of a satisfied clientele. I mention this
only because it may be of importance to youin working out your public
relations. Some have said that they call for a certain type of hair cut
but littie heed is given, This seems to be prevalent and one individual
even said he would pay $3.00 before he would return. I do not say these
things to discourage you, but apparently there is something that you also
must do to warrant the favor of the clientele in this area.
We hope all matters work out to your good. We shall, of course, again
instruct these young men to cease their hair cutting efforts.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
