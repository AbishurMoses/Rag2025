Dear Elder James:
I presented your request, that we grant credit to college students
taking part in the M.V. travel tour to Europe this summer, to the
Academic Policies Committee. The feeling was that it would not be
possible for us to grant any credit on the college level for the tour
primarily because it is not imder the auspices of an accredited
educational institution. In other words, we would not only run into
problems with the Southern Accrediting Association, but also we
could not defend this academically since it is not specifically geared
to an educational program. This does not detract, however, from
the value of such a tour. We would Hke to encourage our students to
take part as it appears to be a very wonderful opportunity to see
Europe at a greatly reduced zate.
I do appreciate your interest and inquiry about the possibllity of
such an arrangement. Iam sure you realize, however, the problems
we would face in giving credit for something that was not structured
specifically as an educational experience.
If you should have any further question, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
AÃ§ademic Dean
