Dear Mrs. Hoxie:
We are pleased to submit two application blanks for your use and a
1962-63 college bulletin. At present we are re-writing the bulletin
but the information in the old bulletin will give you an excellent idea
on oux program here at the college. You will also note the information
in the financial section on student housing for married couples.
The college operates on the policy that oux first obligation in terms
of employment Is to our xesidence hall students. A number of
married students work in the college industries but you can readily
understand the zeason for such a policy. We do have a large
commercial bakery which does it's own hiring and employs over
one hundred students. This is also true of the cabinet shop. The
college operates a number of other industries and it may be possible
for you to receive employment from this source. We voould recom-
mend, however, that you try to seek employment off campus. Ido
not lnow what your qualifications are, therefore, it would be difficult
to make recommendations at this time.
Iwould encourage you to write to Mr. Donald West, the Director of
Student Finance, and he would be able to give you more information.
If we can be of any further help to you, please let us hear from you
at your convenience.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
