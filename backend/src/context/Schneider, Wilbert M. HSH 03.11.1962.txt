Dr. w. M. Schneider, Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Doctor Schneider:
I enjoyed our brief visit on the telephone just the
other day, and appreciated your willingness to make
arrangements for our visit to Southern Missionary
College. I believe I mentioned that Mr. Stewart,
our Personnel Director, will be accompanying me on
this trip.
If I understood properly, we will be able to speak
to the nurses in one of their class periods on the
morning of Tuesday, April 3, for perhaps twenty minutes,
and a banquet will be arranged for them that same
evening. We would be happy to entertain the junior
nursing students at our banquet also, along with the
seniors.
We would like to have opportunity to make some personal
interviews on the morning of April 4.
Thank you once again for your kind help. We look for-
ward to visiting your school.
Yours very sincerely,
D. T. Hawley
Director of Public Relations
DTH/m
