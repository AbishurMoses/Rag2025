Mr. Arnold Otto
Vice Principal
A. W. Spalding Elementary School
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Brother Otto:
We wish to thank you for the service rendered during the
summe I school session. We too often take for granted that
service should be rendered without recognition.
The Dean's Office usually is able to determine the pulse
of appreciation on the part of students. Not only have
students spoken of your excel 1lent work during the Summer
period, but I have received letters specifically mentioning
a word of appreciation for your teaching. We enjoy
words that commend our teachers.
receiving
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schme ider
Academic Dean
