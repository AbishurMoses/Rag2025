Dear Brother Ristau:
We have been waiting for sometime to receive any additional
requests for the Career Scholarship which the Publishing
Department is making available this yéar. We have not had
many applications for this schol larship avard but I am send-
ing you the application which was received from Mr. IaVoy
Garner. His student identification card is attached.
Would you kindly return the attached card immediately in
order that Mr. Garner may use it for admission to Lyceum
programs on this campus.
Perhaps you remember Mr. Garner as a colporteur in the
Alatuama-irsismippi Conference. You wi1l also remember
that his brother Julius Garner gave you very satisfactory
service as a colporteur and is presently enrolled at
Loma Linda taking the medical course.
We hesitate to wait for any additionai application. We
wi1l be pleased to hear from you at anytime.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M, Schmeider
Academic Dean
