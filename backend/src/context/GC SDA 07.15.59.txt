Dr. G. E. Shankel

Seattle 33, Washington
Dear Brother Shankel:
I greatly appreciate your letter of July 9 in which you suggested
the name of Dr. Stanley Bull as a possible candidate for the presidency
of the college in Jamaica.
His name was first in line as suggested by the Division but when
Elder Dunbar contacted Walla Walla College, he was informed that the
withdrawal of Dr. Bull at this time might jeopardize the accreditation
of the college. It seems that the institution is coming up for inspection
this fall. We have heard through the grapevine that Dr. Bull would like
very much to go to Jamaica, but apparently he would not care to leave
the United States unless this country is recognized as his homeland.
His present status is that of a worker who came to the United States on
his own responsibility and according to the policy must work in this
country for 10 years before he is entitled to sustentation at the
United States rate.
These factors have influenced the committee to look elsewhere for
a man to fill this post in Jamaica. So far as I am concerned personally
I would be very happy if the way would open for Dr. Bull's appointment
as president of the College.
We are investigating two other names and hope that soon we may
be able to find an acceptable candidate. Some are heartily in favor of
appointing Dr. Tobiassen while others feel that it might be risky to do
sO.
Yours sincerely,
N. W. Dunn
