Dear Friend:
Our college press finds itself in reed of a good proof
reader. Would you please check to see if you have on
your records anyone who would qualify and who would be
interested in this type of work. We would naturally
prefer an English major.
If you can locate any talented person who would fit
into this position we would be most grateful for the
information. Thank you for any help you may be able
to give.
Sincerely yours,
su ut
