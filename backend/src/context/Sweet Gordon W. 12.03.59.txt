Southern Mis sionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear President Rees:
The Council of the Commission on Colleges and Universities is aware of
discussions among educator S in the Southern. Region regarding standards,
practices, and new activities in teaching by T. V., extension, corre-
spondence, etc. These programs are covered in general by Standards 15
and 21 for Senior Colleges. Essentially as a result of these discussions,
the Council appointed a special committee to gather from the colleges
information on problems, practices, and recommendations.
The Council authorized the committee to send a questionnaire to the
colleges and requests that you and other personnel in your institution
contribute to this study by completing and returning as soon as possible
the enclosed information sheets, Frankness is desired with an assurance
by the Council that this is in no way a check on accreditation, It is a
further effort on the part of the Association to promote understanding
among the colleges on the activities of each other and to take another look
at the Standards for a reflection of majority actions and opinions.
The president may complete the questionnaire if he wishes because his
plans and opinions will be valuable, It is requested, however, that
administrators most concerned with the programs listed also complete
the questionnaire. The college may return to this office one copy as a
composite reply or several copies representing different administrators.
Please do not hesitate to present conflicting opinions within an institution
if they exi st. Additional copies will be sent you immediately upon request.
Sincerely your s,
brhnb a
Gordon W. Sw eet
Executive Secretary
