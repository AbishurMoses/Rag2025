Dear Miss Parker:
We are pleased to submit a copy of our student
handbook entitied "SNC and You." Although this was
brought up to date last summer, there will be a few items
in the revision for the coming school year.
We hope it will be helpful to you as you give study
to your oWI revision of your handbook.
Very sincerely yours,
