Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Cassell:
Thank you so much for your letter and for the telephone call
regarding the invitation to join the faculty of Southern Missionary
College. I am sure I would have found the work there both challeng-
ing and satisfying, and the opport tunity to work with you would, in-
deed, have been a privilege. As much as I personally would have
liked to join the staff, I feel a commitment to Walla Walla College
since last year I was granted a leave of absence for advanced S tudy.
May God richly bless you in your work at Southern Missionary
College.
Sincerely yours,
Evelyn Rittenhoyse, Chairman
Secretarial Science Department
