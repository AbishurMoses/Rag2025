Gainesville, Florida
Dear Mrs. Petty:
Enclosed is a transcript of credits earned on this campus.
Because of your request to take Freshman Composition by
correspondence from Home Study Institute, the registrar referred
the letter to me. It would not be wise for you to take this
course by correspondence and ask us to give credit for it on
the transeript. We do not permit our students to take this
class by correspondence because of its very fundamental nature
to the entire 8o 1lege program. Students need to learn to express
themselves both orally and in writing, and it is our hope to
accomplish this for the students. We have an excellent English
Department and we have not permitted students the privilege of
taking Freshman Composition by correspondence.
May I suggest, however, that you work through the University
of Florida if you plan to attend that institution in the
future. Inasmuch as we are presently sending your a transeript
that you can present to the university, it may be that they
would permit correspondenge work in this conrse if you took it
from their institution. Many of the state institutions have
a correspondence department. This is only a suggestion.
The fee for the transeript that has been sent is $1.00. We
wi1l appreciate payment of this in the near future.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M, Schne ider
Academic Dean
