meeting on campus November 10. Will you be here for this NANI committee? I think
1t important to maintain the many works of historical value and to utilize properly the
volumes of special interest to the college st tudent.
In our office. we have about eighteen files--1 three arefireproof with combination locks.
These three we would wish to transfer to SMC, provided we can reduce our records that
much. I have every. reason to believe we can do this in time. I would think the other
files and the equipment could be used in the new unit. We have two regular typewriters
and one IBM, plus an electric adding machine. We have also four desks, two bookcases
and several chairs. The 3M Thermofax is of the old type without a self timer which
wastes paper. The trade-in value on a new model is very low. It is however in good
state of repair as preventive maintenance has been maintained all along.
I am still of the opinion that we could use this library. and the dormitory here,
much cheaper and with as much efficiency as a new unit and with a much more desirable
location. I cannot see the proposed location. It is the most undesirable spot on
campus, , for th√© following reasons: :
(1) Too near the psychlatric area.
(2) Too near the main roads.
(3) Too near two undesirable communities of
(a) white
(b) negro
I recognize that Kentucky-T Tennessee is planning on. using the college area but I
would suggest that they scuttle the idea of a boarding academy on campus. I think
this a poor setting for such. A day academy I see, but the other I'm afraid I can-
not get up much enthusiasm in its behalf. After three years as Dean of Men and with
a total of six years of government committee participation on this campus, I think I
am qualified to express a reliable opinion on the problems that will be faced in this
enyiromment. No, I'm afraid I could not give support to the proposed program, not to
be difficult and non-cooperative but because a basic principle is involved. The blue-
print of Christian education calls for a rural environment for our academy youth.
Madison has an. environment which demands the more mature student. I recognize that my
views have little or no weight under the present circumst tances, nevertheless I feel a
responsibility in making them known to those who are influential.
Attached you will find copies of two letters received from past t presidents of the
ASMC--Associated Students of Madison College. I thought you might like to have them
for the record.
I apologize for the lengthy epistle.
Very sincere: ly,
