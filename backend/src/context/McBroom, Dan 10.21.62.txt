Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. McBroom:
In order to do an effective job in teaching the graphic arts
it will be necessary for us to up grade our equipment. At a
meeting of the Finance Committee this morning, it was voted
to approve your request for the press which is available with
a kluge feeder for approximately $475. Perhaps you will wish
to secure a requisition for this purpose.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
