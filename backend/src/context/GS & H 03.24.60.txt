Dr. G. E. Shankel, Academic Dean
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Shankel:
A visit to our senior colleges has been arranged and approved
for me that will include Southern Miss sionary College about April 12.
While at Southern Missionary College I would be very pleased
to visit members of your Senior Class of 1960 that we might interest in
employment with this institution.
We are interested in finding two individuals, one of which is
looking forward to becoming a pharmacist. This institution would be
willing to invest materially in the proper candidate if one could be
found who would be interested in denominational work as a pharmacist. If
you can think of someone in your Senior Class that looks forward to this
as a profession, I would appreciate this information and an interview
with him at the time I am at S. M. C.
The second individual we are looking for is one capable as an
instructor and director of our new swimming pool facilities. This candi-
date should be about 25 years of age with life guard training and leader-
ship ability. If you have someone in your Senior Class that is interested
in this type of activity, I would like to talk with him.
I am looking forward to seeing Southern Missionary College on
this trip.
Very sincerely yours,
Le M Dunn, Personnel Director
