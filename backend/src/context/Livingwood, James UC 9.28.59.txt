Dear Doctor Livingood:
-
As chairman of the Social Science Division here at
Southern Missionary College, I am very much interested
in the announcement in the press a few days ago concerning
the three-day symposium in connection with the Civil
War Centennial being observed October 23-25.
Dr. Jerome Clark, who is a new teacher with us this year
and who is teaching in the field of Ame rican History, is
also interested. I wonder whether it would be possible
for both of us to attend some of the sessions.
You are to be commended for bringing together such a
program, and we would very much like to have the privilege
of sitting in on the sessions.
With very kindest regards, I an
Sincerely yours,
G. B. Shankel
