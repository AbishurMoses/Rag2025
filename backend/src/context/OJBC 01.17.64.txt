Dear Bill:
My letter to you requesting an appropriation to re-new the
William A. Iles Scholarship Fund came as a result of my
understanding that I needed to write a formal request to you for
these funds. Certainly we do not want to place any hardship on
you in anyway and would not want you to have to borrow this
money to send to us right away. We will be most happy to
receive it whenever it is available to you. Actually it will not
be appropriated to a student until next fall anyway and therefore
is no rush.
We greatly appreciate your generosity and interest in the college
in establishing this scholarship fund. The students who have been
recipients have been extremely appreciative. In many cases it has
made the difference between continuing in the college and having to
withdraw.
Best wishes to you for the new year.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean

Dear Jack:
I have your letter of December 31 and it has somewhat con-
cerned me since receiving it.
Several times prior to the end of the year I mentioned to you
and mentioned to Kenny Davis that I would have to take care
of the matter before the end of the tax period. When it got
down toward the end of the year, I meant to send you a check
at the same time I sent a check to Chick Fleming for the
Committee of One Hundred. In the rush of the last few days of
the year, the matter slipped my attention, and I did not think
of it again until this past week end when I received your
letter.
Jack, I shall replenish that fund, but it will not be until
about the end of March. You may go ahead on the assumption
of the usual 1 amount, but it will not actua 1ly be sent until
the last of March unless the situation is so critical that you
would like for me to go down and borrow it.
Thank you again for handling this and I shall look forward to
seeing you on the 6th of February.
Sincerely,
William A. Iles
Vice President
