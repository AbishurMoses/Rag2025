Dear Doctor Milton:
We have endeavored to promote the conference on improving
arrangements for learning in Tennessee Colleges and Universities
to be held on your campus December 3-4. At the present time we have
three faculty members who have indicatedia desire to attend the meet-
ings. They are as follows:
Dr. K. M. Kennedy, Head, Department of Education
Mr. Carl Miller, Associate Professor of Psychiatric Nursing
Elder Bruce Johnston, Head, Department of Religion
I am also trying to arrange my program in order to be in attendance.
I am looking forward to this conference as I feel it will be most
beneficial and timely.
Very sincerely yours,
