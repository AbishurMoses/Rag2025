Dear Mr. Hamilton:
By this time you will have received the book which I mailed a few
days agoe I hope that you will find it useful. and informative.
You may recall that during our conversation at the time of
visit her√® that we discussed for a few moments the question of the your
continuity of the weekly cycle from the beginning of time in unbroken
sequence until our own day. I promised to send you some material on
this, and I am now taking this occasion of enclosing some articles
which I clipped from this paper many years ago and which I have never
used since; but I remembered that I did have these in my file of
clippings thinking that they might come in useful some time.
You will notice that two of these articles, Part 1 and Part 2 of
the series entitled "The Antiquity and the Unbroken Sequence," are by
F. D. Nichol, the editor of our denominational weekly periodical. The
other article is one of a series by Carlyle B. Haynes entitled "The
Identical Seventh Day." I regret to find that I did not keep the
entire series on this topic, but, anyway, there are some good thoughts
in this one article published in the May 21, 1938, issue.
I hope you will find this likewise useful in establishing the fact
that the weekly cycle comes from ancient time with unbroken sequence
in spite of all the changes in dalendars. This change-af-calendr idea
is very confusing to some people that t do not see how there could be some
change in calendar without altering the weekly cycle, but I think these
articles will make this point interesting and profitable. I do not
possess another copy of these so if you will be kind enough to return
these as soon as you have looked them overo
Trusting that these may prove interesting and that you will enjoy
this interesting discussion, I am
Very sincerely your brother,
