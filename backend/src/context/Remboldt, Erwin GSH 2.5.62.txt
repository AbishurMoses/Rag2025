Dr. Wilbert M. Schneider

Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Schneider:
Re√ßeived your letter in which you state one of your graduates is interested
in hospital work that would possibly eventually lead him to the post of
serving in the capacity of a hospital administrator.
The Glendale Sanitarium and Hospital does not have a business internship
similar to the one that was worked out at Loma Linda University. We are
affiliated with the University of Chicago and also with Washington Uni-
versity, where we participate on an internship or residency program
whereby the field work makes them eligible for a degree of Master' 's in
Business Administ tration from one of these universities. They tell me,
from these universities, that it would be very undesirable to have two
internship programs going on simultaneously.
At the present time we do not have an opening in the business fields; we
have been very fortunate in that our men have stayed with us. I believe
Mr. Dunn is planning a recruitment trip to Southern Missionary College in
the next week or so.
We are having groundbreaking for the mental health wing on February 14. We
had our bid opening a few days ago and find that the bids were very competitive
and fairly well within our established budget.
Very sincerely yours,
Morbet
hot 9.
