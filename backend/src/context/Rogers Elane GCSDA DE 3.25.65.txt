Dear Friends:
We are enclosing the forms for ma king the Closing Reports for your institutions for
the 1964-65 school year.
At its meeting on February 9, 1965, the Committee on the Cost of Denomina tional
Education requested that a study be made of the employing of student readers in our
colleges and universities and the expense that t is involved. The following action
wa S taken:
VOTED, Tha t the General Conference Department of Education add a question
to the College Closing Report requesting the amount and cost of student
rea der labor employed in each department each year, this to be in dollars
and number of student readers employed.
Therefore, you will find an additional page attached to the Closing Report form on
which you may record these statistics.
The committee also recommended that a separate account be kept on your books for
this particular area of student labor.
Thank you so much for all the help you give us on this.
With best wishes.
Very sincerely yours,
ave Begevu
