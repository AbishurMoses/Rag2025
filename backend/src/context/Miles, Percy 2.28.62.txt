Mr. Percy Miles, Manager.
Loma Linda Food Company
Box 388
Mount Vernon, Ohio
Dear Perey:
We appreciate so much the generosity of the Loma Linda Food
Company in providing worthwhile gifts for the forthcoming
"Producers on Parade" program.
I have had the privilege of discussing the matter with Mr.
Wayne VandeVere who is head of the Business Department and
by persuasion, I have learned he has agreed to be the master
of ceremonies. This I think is fortunate in that he will do
a good job and will keep the program moving along. He was
reluctant to take this assignment because it is the usual
procedure to have a qual lified student serve in this capacity,
but I think it will work out better in that this is the first
program of its kind on this campus.
We will plan the progzam around eight cases of assorted canned
goods,at least two sets of baseballs and gloves for the children's
section and two transistor radios, one of which will be used for
a complete cast of young ladies in competition with each other
and another for the winner of the complete men's cast competing
one with another. Since both Mr. VandeVere and Mrs. VandeVere
are well supplied with wrist watches, they expressed delight
in the receipt of a transistor radio. This of course would
mean three transistor radios and if this is alligightiwith you,
you may proceed on that basis.
Thank you again for your generosity and 1f it is possible, I
will plan to spend Sabbath, March 10 with you at Mount Vernon.
If it does not work out that I can be there, I shail let you
know, later.
Very sincerely your friend,
Wi lbert M. Schneider
