Mr. H. F. Meyer, Manager
College Press
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Meyer:
We would be pleased to use Mr. Dan McBroom for the teaching
of our college class in Typography. According to the class
schedule, we have made it possible for this class to be
taught at a time when it would be most convenient for your
operation in the press. We have listed the class to be
arranged and we know that there will not be very many taking
the class so it will be possible to meet the class at a time
when it will least interfere with the work Mr. MeBroom is
doing at the press.
Inasmuch as the academy classes will not be taught next year,
we sincerely hope that this arrangement will be possible on
the college level.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
