Dear Brother Park:
We are pleased with your interest in our gradua tes and hope
that it will be possible for us to satisfy some of your needs.
Although we mailed to most of our organizations and conferences
our brochure listing prospective seniors, we do not know whether
one was mailed to your office. We are, therefore, enclosing one
of these brochures for your perusal.
Would you kindly let us know your needs and we shall endeavor
to find competent individuals to serve your institution.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi lbert M. Schneider
