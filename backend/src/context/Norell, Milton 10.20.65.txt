Dear Doctor Norrell:
I appreciated the opportunity of talking with you on the phone last
Sunday.
I have now had an opportunity to talk with Dr. Futcher, the teacher
of our World Geography course. He tells me that he does not conduct
his course on a lecture basis and feels that much of the discussion that
takes place between he and the students would not be relevant to a
correspondence type course. Consequently, he is of the opinion that
his comrse would not be one that we would want to tape.
It is my feeling that I would not want to put any pressure on a teacher
to have his course taped if he were not in full agreement. I am sure
you can understand my reasoning.
I am pleased to know, however, that you are interested in continuing
your education with the Home Study Institute and assure you that we
will do all within our power to be of assistance wherever possible. I
also appreciate your offer to purchase tapes for recording lectures
here on the campus. It could well be that we could work this our in
a Survey of Civilization course since in most cases, it is taught on a
lecture basis. As I mentioned to you on the phone, however, Iwould
not want to do this this year since Dr. Lebedoff is a new teacher. If
there are other things that you would have an interest in, I would be
more than glad to explore these possibilities.
Most sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
