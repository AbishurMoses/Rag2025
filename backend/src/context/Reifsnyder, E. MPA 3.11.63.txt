Mr. Bd Reifsinyder, Principal
Mount Pisgah Academy
Candler, North Carolina
Dear Brother Reifsnyder:
Thanks for your nice letter which pertains to the proposed
testing program. I have discussed this matter with Elder Becker
of the Union Conference and he, too, is enthusiastic about it.
Inasmuch as the Educational Board Meeting is being scheduled at
the time of the Union Conference Constituency meeting, he has
suggested that we discuss this matter when all the principals can
be together. I will, therefore, bring whatever information we have
to that meeting and I hope ie will be possible for us to discuss all
matters pertaining to the secondary schools and the college.
Vexy sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
