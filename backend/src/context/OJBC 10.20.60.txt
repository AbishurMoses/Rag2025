Dear Mr. Iles:
It was so very kind of you to mail us a check in the
amount of $250 for our Morthy Student Fund. This amount
will make it possible for one of our seniors- to remain
in school this year and finish his work.
Mr. Crawford is a fine young man and, as a business
student, should be able to serve the denomination or
society in a very acceptable manner.
Thank you again for your interest in our students.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

Dear Dr. Schneider:
Thank you for your letter of October 13. I was
afraid that perhaps the scholarship was not going
to be used this year. It was certainly my desire
that it should be given in prospect of helping a
student rather than in making up a bad debt as it
had been incurred.
I am pleased at the award that you have suggested
and my check is enclosed.
Thank you for the opportunity which you have made
for Mr. Crawford and for me. .
Very truly yours,
1X LRuw
