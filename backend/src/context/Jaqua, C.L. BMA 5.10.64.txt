Dear Jake:
In accordance with our conversation at Meridian, I told you Iwald keep
you informed in terms of any openings here in student persomel field.
At the present time it appears that we will continue with the program as
it is. We have already made some changes this year and the feeling is
that we should not change the student personnel program for at least
another year.
Personally, I am stlll interested in a professional program and think
that you could do the job very nicely. Probably there are changes and
improvements at Bass that you would like to see made in the next year
anyway and by that time we will be able to assess our program here a
little better in the eventsome reorganization is necessary.
I hope you will find opportunity to continue with your graduate work
since you are so close to completion of the doctoral degree.
Best wishes to you as you contime to give leadership to the program
at Bass.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
