Dear Dr. Cassell:
Seasons Greetings. I hope you are having a good school
year.
As we approach the New Year, I feel the necessity of
making plans for 1965. To help me narrow down these plas,
I would like to Imnow what you are planning there at Southern
lissionary College which might include me. If you are still
considering me and would like to discuss this consideration,
I will be in Calhoun, Georgia December 22 to 27. At which
time I could come to Collegedale to visit with you. We will
be leaving Andrews about Sunday, December 20. If you wish
to contact me after that date I will be at the George Pearman
residence in Calhoun.
Thank you for your interest.
Sincerely,
ha &
