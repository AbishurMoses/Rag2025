Dear Dean Cassell:
In your letter of September 22 regarding my request of
college credit for the college tour of 1960, I am glad
left the way open for me to contact you again.
you
It was not my plan to audit the course. When Dr. Shankel
stated that I would be auditing the course, I never thought I
would need the credit for renewal of my certificate. Dr.
Shankel knew I had my Master's degree and would not need it
for graduate credit. Neither he nor I at that time realized
that I would need it later for certificate renewal. I need
only two hours. I shall be glad to pay the balance of the
tuition if the credit can be granted.
Since Dr. Jerome Clark was on that tour, I am asking him
to contact you regarding the merits of my request.
Sincerely yours,
Jesse Jon√®s
