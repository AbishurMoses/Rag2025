Gentiemen:
Because of a former action taken by the science teachers of the
Seventh-day Adventist colleges and a recent action by our
Curriculum Committee requesting a reprinting of "Principles
and True Science" by M, E. Cady. Iam writing this letter for
information concerning the development of this project. Would
you lindly let us know what is being done about the publication of
this book, or perhaps I should say the reprinting of this book.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
