Dear Jim:
Word has come to me that you are in the armed services and will be
serving a term of three years. While in the service of your country
you will be involved in many experiences. It is our hope that you will
make the best of your stay in the service.
It would be well for you to take advantage of every possibility of
increasing your technical know-how. Obviously we are very much
concerned that you use good judgment in all matters of conscience.
Our thoughts are always with you and you can rest assured that your
heavenly Father will continue to draw you with his cords of love. You
will never be able to remove yourself from the love of the Father. It
is possible for any of us to force a separation with our own iniquities
but the Father is still there anxious to serve if we choose to behelped.
You will have a great deal of time to think and we wish to encourage you
to use your time to good advantage. Courage will come to you if you
continue to search the scriptures and pray daily. This is our wish for
you.
It may be that you will have the opportunity to secure some professional
career while in the army. In any event put forth every effort to grow in
the stature of your Lord and Saviour.
It will be a pleasure to hear from you as you find time to write. At this
time we are endeavoring to close off another school lyear. Just a few
days ago I accepted an invitation to join the staff of Pacific Union College
as Academic Dean We hope to serve the lyoung people in that area as
it has been our privilege to serve here. Out there I will get acquainted
with one of your relatives serving as Dean of Men. Our kindest regards
to you and please let us hear from you as you find time to write.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
gi
Academic Dean
