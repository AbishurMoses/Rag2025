Dear Frank:
We were pleased to receive notice from the General Conference
that you have been given a release for service on our campus
December 8-11, 1961. We will be happy to invite you to this
campus and inasmuch as you have many friends here, it will not
be too difficule for you to abide with us awhile.
Inasmuch as our Student Association is planning a series'of
top noteh lectures designed to give students food for thought,
we are anious that the Sunday night lecture, December 10, be
of the most attractive nature. President Rees is anxious, of
course, that you take the chapel service Monday morning but
we are inviting in members of the community and any others
that wi1l be interested in your subject for the Sumday night
meeting. In order that we may crysta. lize this matter, would
you again give us a definite title for your Sunday night lecture
which we can use for advertising purposes and also we would be
pleased to receive any cut or mats that could be used for news-
paper advertising service.
I have one personal request to make. Inasmich as I am sponsor
of the senior elass, I would like to request that you make
yourself available for a discussion attended by seniors and
their wives and/or husbands on Friday night, December 8. This
also is a request coming from the senior class. If this is
possible, would you please let me know immediately.
We are very pleased to have you come to this campus and we
shall endeavor to make your stay here pleasant.
Very cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
