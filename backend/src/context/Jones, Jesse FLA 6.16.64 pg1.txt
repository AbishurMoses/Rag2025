Mr. Jesse Jones
Forest Lake Academy
Maitland, Florida
Dear Mr. a Jones:
Some time ago Mr. William Taylor, Director of College Relations,
mentioned to me that he had talked with you while he was on the campus
at Forest Lake. It seems there was some problem you were facing
in terms of a teaching certificate and you were wondering if it would
be possible for you to receive credit from Southern Missionary College
for a trip you had taken to Europe a few summers ago. I wouid appreciate
hearing from you concerning this. I believe any details that you could
give us concerning your needs academically and the trip you took would
be most helpful to the Academic Policies Committee in considering your
request.
If you should have any further question about this, please feel free to
contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
