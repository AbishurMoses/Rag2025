Dear Mr. Schnepper:
In the year 1956 the Public Affairs Press published my book
entitled, "The American Bankers Association, Its Past and
Present. : Up to now I have not received an accouting of
the number of copies sold. I wonder whet thez this could be
done to satisfy my curiosity.
Several of the local bankers in this area have expressed
an interest in copies of this book and I an, therefore,
inquiring whether you still have a few on hand. I would
be pleased to receive two copies of this book at an early
date.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
