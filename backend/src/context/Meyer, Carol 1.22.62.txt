Miss Carol Ann Meyer
330 Conard Hall
College Place, Washington
Dear Carol:
Your letter is most interesting and your observations have
been so well taken. Certainly life has been a rose bud to
you opening with every new revelation. The interesting thing
about it all is that this particular rose need never close but
continually opens up with every new pedal showing forth still
more of the wisdom of God. We sincerely hope that this will
be your experience and also that of the young man whom you
plan to marry.
I have been very nuch interested in what you have said about
Dr. Silver's classes. I have known Dr. Silver for a number
of years and of course both he and his wife were students at
Walla Walla College when I taught there,in the forties. I have
appreciated both of them very much and it was a delight to meet
Mrs. Silver again when she was on our campus last fa1l during
the college section meeting.
Your educational progran this year appears to, be most interesting
Plenty of education, literature, ete. makes it appear as if you
are attempting to finish off with established requirements.
Our summer school bulletin has not yet been published and will
perhaps not be out until March after the Southern Association
delegation has had the opportunity of reviewing our program on
this campus. At this time we are feverishly working to complete
our seif-study program, the handbook, and the bulletin for next
year. A11 of this adds up to a great deal of work.
I shall keep in mind your need for next summer. We hope to
have Miss Lindberg teaching again and perhaps it will be
possibie for hes to offer the class in Advanced Grammar. We
shall send you a bulletin as soon as it is ready.
Please give our friends, the Silvers, the Aplingtons, the
Christians, the Spoos, your dean of women, Mrs. Helen Evans,
