Mr. Sammy Joyce

Chattanooga, Tennessee
Dear Mr. . Joyce:
I have checked with the members of the summer graduating class
of Southern Missionary College and find that they will need to order
343 announcements. We have two graduates who are not on campus
and I have written to them both but as yet have not heard from them.
I would very much appreciate it if you could put in aroud 25 extra
amnouncements for these two students. I don't know that they will
be wanting them but we will return what we do not sell.
I would also like name cards for the following people:
C. Thomas Begley
100
Sue Anne Boynton
100
Nildo J. Harper
100
Andrew Hamilton Heckle
500
Frederich Lee Thompson
100
S. C. Ullom
100
Regarding the 500 cards for Andrew Hamilton Heckle, he wants the
500 if he can get them engraved and panelled. If he can only get them
&
engraved, he wants 300. If he can get just the plain card, like I am
ordering the other ones, he only wants 200. I hope I have made that
plain.
25
The other name cards I want to order just plain artcraft. I believe
$1 .00
they are $1,95 per hundred. I am enclosing an announcement that
we would like them made up by.
I plan to call this order in to you but wanted to send this letter to verify
the order. We would appreciate this as soon as possible. Thanks very
much for the fine service from Josten's.
Sincerely yours,
Gladys Lawless
