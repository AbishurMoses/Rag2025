Dear Brother Palmer:
This to request that Blder R. F. Cottrell be granted permission
to visit Southern Missionary College on March 2 to present one
of the lectures in a series that will be presented during the first
two weeks of March. We feel that Elder Cottrell can make an
excellent contribution to this series of lectures dealing with the
authenticity of the Bible and that his visit will be a source of
inspiration to the students at the college.
We believethat Elder: Cottrell's experience in education has
prepared him to deal with this topic most satisfactorily. In
talking with Elder Nichol on the phone recently concerning our
lecture series, he recommended that I request Elder Cottrell's
services. I trust it will be possible for him to receive authori-
zation for this trip. I assure you it will be greatly appreciated
by the faculty and students at Southern Missionary College.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
