Dear Folks:
Just received your letter and thought I would answer it before I get
involved in this class schedule again.
I just talked to Mr. Futcher and told him that you were rounding up
your correspondence work and asked him if we couldn' 't issue your
degree when we received your transcript from Home Study since,
by accident, you did graduate officially in June. He said he didn't
see why not so you won't need to go through the same rigmarole
again this summer. So as soon as we receive your transcript from
Home Study, I'lI personally see that you get your degree. I was
thinking you sent your $10 fee when you made your request to graduate
in absentia in June. If you didn't, this is a necessity before we can
send the degree. One day we will get you all graduated and taken care
of, George.
Glad to know that all of you are fine and I'm looking forward to seeing
the baby.
Sincerely yours,
Gladys
