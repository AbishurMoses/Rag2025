Dear Brothes Meyer:
We wish to thank you sincerely for an excellent job
Oli the College Bulletin. This was also done with dispatch.
I have not had the chance to read through the bulletin,
but it looks as if it is one of our better catalogues.
Thanks again for this excellent service.
Very sincerely youxs,
Wilbert M. Schneider
