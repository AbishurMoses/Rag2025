TENNESSEE, USA.
Dear Brother Schneider:
In Elder Pierson's post this morning was the copy of a letter you
had written to Elder Do Lowe of Sierra Leone, West Africa, regarding the Elder
offer of a hospital which Chief Songo had made to Bishop Tomlinsono but
Pierson is awas from Salisbury at present, visiting in Ruanda-Urundi,
on his behalf I am attending to this matter.
I believe you isent this copy to Elder Pierson thinking Sierra Leone
in the territory of the Southern African Division, and how we wish this
was offer could have been made in our Division territory! But Sierra Leone
is in the territory of the Northern Buropean Division, 3o to save a little
time I an sending the copy of your letter on to Elder A. F. Tarr in England.
I trust this meets with your approval.
With our kind Christian greetings from Southern Africa and wishing
you the continued blessings of the Lord in your service,
Ioursvsry sincerely,
arukrs
SÃ©cretary
Robert H. Pierson
