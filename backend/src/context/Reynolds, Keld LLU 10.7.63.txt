Dear Dean Reynolds:
I was very happy to receive a copy of your new policy book. I think it
is very well organized and incorparates a mumber af excellent ideas.
I like the loose leaf aspect with one policy area to a page. This way it
is very easy to keep new and revised policies up to date.
I am forwarding with this letter a copy df our working policy and handbook.
This was just revised during the academic year of 1961-62 80 it is
relatively up to date. In our next revision, however, Iwould like to put
it in a form similar to your's. I think it is much more usable than it
is in its present form.
I trust you are having a successful year at Loma Linda University.
As you probably know by now, we have had quite an increase in
enrollment here at Southern Missionary College. In fact, we are up
over one hundred students which is quite a gain for us. This is placing
some real strain on our facilities but I believe our board is going to
come to our aid in a speeded up building program. Southern Missionary
College is truly a school on the move and a very challenging place in
which to work.
I would be very happy to receive any other handbooks or reference
tools which you may be presently using at Loma Linda.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
