Dear Doctor and Mrs. Leffler:
I have just read one of your greeting letters for the
Christmas season. I have persona 1ly appreciated lmowing
you during the brief period of time prior to your retire-
ment. You mst be very happy there at Berrien and I am
sure that you wi1l be able to find plenty of things to do
to keep you occupied.
Perhaps it will be my opportunity to see you sometime in
March while attending the Conference on Higher Education
in Chicago. As you may recall, I took two years out of
education in treasurers work. This was an enjoyable
experience but after having served education for approxi-
mately nineteen years, I became somewhat bored and decided
to throw my lot back with the people in education. In this
type of work, one hasn't time to expei rience -Soredouzm.On
the contrary life is just a little too hectic rat times. We
are enjoying our work here at S. M. C. very much.
We wish you health and the blessings that attend a 1ife
well lived. With kindest thoughts and wishes for a very
happy holiday season and a good new year, I remain
Cordially your friend,
Wi lbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
