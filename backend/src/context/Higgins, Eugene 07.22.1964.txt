Dear Mr. Higgins:
I am writing to you in regard to our 1957 Building Form for Southern
Missionary College. We understand this data is in your office. We
have zeceived a questionmaire from George Peabody College for Teachers
dealing with higher education. We need this material as soon as possible
in order to complete this questionnaire.
I am enclosing the letter from Mr. James W. Colmey and a copy of the
report to which I am referring. Perhaps this will assist you in getting
this data. Please return the enclosures to me.
Thank you very much for this information.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jx.
