Dear Doctor Smith:
Inasmuch as Keith Kopitzke was with us only one year, it is
hardly possible for us to evaluate him fairly. Perhaps you
will be able to secuze an evaluation from a college subsequently
attended.
His cousin, Bruce, is with this year and doing very we1l. Keith
during his freshman year on our campus did average work. In
some subjects he received grades of "D" but I believe his G.P.A.
would average out to at least 1. As far as we remember, Keith
was a fine fellow but no one seems to know hin sufficiently to
attempt an evaluation.
Sorry we camot be of too mch help in this case.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
