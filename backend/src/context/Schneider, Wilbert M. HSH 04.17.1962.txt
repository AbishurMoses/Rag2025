Dr. W. M. Schneider
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee.
Dear Dr. Schneider:
Brother Stewart and I were so: rry that we did not get to
see you before leaving Collegedale, because we wanted to
thank you personally for the kindness and hospitality
we were sho own during our recÃªnt visit. We also wanted
to mention the fact that since most of the students were
obligated to Orlando, we did not attempt to get them to
disregard their obligation but merely consentrated on
giving a favorable impression of Hinsdale, hoping the they
might come here some time in the future.
Thank you for sending through the voucher for the meal
we had in your very fine cafeteria. I asked the girl at
the end of the serving line whether I should pay her at
that time or whether we should be billed and she did not
know. I trust that by this time you have already received
our check; I asked our head accountant to please send this
on a few days ago.
Thanking you once again for a very fine visit to a lovely
campus.
Very sincerely yours
D. T. Hawley
Director of Public Relations.
