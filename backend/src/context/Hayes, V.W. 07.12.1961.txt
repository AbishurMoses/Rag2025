Dear Brother and Sister Hayes:
You will he interested to knou that the Cazolina Conference
sent us a check in the amount of $125 to be applied to Ruth's
account at Cedarcroft Hospital in Mashington, D. C. As an
educational institution, we of course could not match this
suR, If we did, it would establish a precedent to assist
any student sho become 11l while in attendance. This of
course does not sinimize our interest in Rath and we took the
matter to members of our Board of Trustees. The Carolina
check was endorsed ovex to the Union Conference and they in
turn wiFl match this Sim and send the total of approximately
$250 to Cedarcroft.
There are those of us on the campus wdio personally wish to
help also. I have just visited with Doctor Clyde Bushnell in
regard to this mattez, and he too is willing to help but it
seems best to wait until the members of our faculty have returned
to the campus. During the latter part of August our faculty will
be together again and at that tink Iisbals brins up thismatter to
permit freewill donations to a fund which we can send to
Cedarcroft to help defray the expenses for Ruth's treatment.
Ne just wanted to Jet you lmnour that a litele more will be done
from our end as soon as the faculty gets together.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

Dear Doctor Schneider:
I am sorry I did rot get the opportunity to talk to you
while up there at the close of the school yesr. It was my
understanding up to that time that the Hayes had not received
any of the contrilations which I had told them woula bo forth-
coming.
Dssnite all the discounts we have been able to get for
Ruth, it is still costing them well over 500 a month. We are
sending them 200, and it would be wonderful if you folk up
there could at least match this anount.
The Hayes appreciate a1l that you have and are doing for
them, and they deeply regret, their previous attitude toward
the school.
Sincerely,
Sdadluchin
