Dear Dean Shankel:
I want to thank you for your response to my recent letter
regarding the senior Pre-Medic students. Am thankful for
your interest and assistance.
Will send you under separate cover a few more than the re-
quired number of cards for your students to complete. Will
appreciate very much your doing this and returning them
me here at the General Conference office.
to
In filling out the cards, I would suggest that all of the
senior Pre-Medical students who have been accepted at Loma
Linda compl√®te them whether they are interested in mission
service or not. I am interested in a long-range study of
the results in this area of our educational program. I
should qualify by saying that I am interested primarily in
the results as far as overseas service is concerned.
Again, many thanks for your helpfulness and best wishes for
your continued success.
Faithfully yours,
C. E. Randolph, M.D.
