Dear Jim:
This is just a short note to inform you that Mr. Futcher and I will
be able to be on your campus December 7 and 8. We will probably
leave here on Monday afternoon, December 6.
We shall look forward to meeting you at that time.
Very sincerely yours,

Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear friend:
I felt as you did that Fred may have hurt himself with the
Merit Scholarship program though his observations may have
been partly true. He is a brilliant boy and has a bright
future if he doesn 't become too radical.
We would appreciate very much having you come for a chapel
period and stay over to talk especially with the seniors.
I am concerned that such a fine college has received a poor
image here. If possible come during December on one of the
following dates: Dec. 7, 11, or 14. If this is impossible
we will work out a time early in the new year.
I would like to see more of this type promotion and if
possible in coming years to arrange College Days a bit
earlier. Too many of the students have their plans all
made before they ever see Southern Missionary.
Elder Johnston is doing a won derful job with the students
during this week of prayer. We are most grateful to you
for arranging this at such a late date.
Sincerely,
J. A. Shepard
