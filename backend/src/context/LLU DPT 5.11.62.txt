Batchelor of the Chattanooga, Tennessee Board of Bducation.
The city of Chat ttanopga has endeavored to locate a physicai
therapist for the Chattanooga School System. This repr√®sents
a very important position and the starting pay is very acceptable.
Mr. Batche lor would very much appreciat te leads on any of our
Seventh-day Adventist men who may be graduating from your
institution oE who has graduated in the past. Should you have
names to suggest, would you kindiy let us inow of such indi-
viduals.
We would very much like to help in placing a man in this
position. We would hope, of course, that the individual
would have the type of personality to go with such an
important Job.

Very sincerely yours,
