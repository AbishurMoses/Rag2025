Dear Miss Davis:
Thank you for your letter of November 2 in which you have
expressed an interest in attending Southern Missionary College
for the purpose of pursuing a major in Chemistry and minors
in Biology and Physics. You are pursuing fields of study which
will equip you to serve the church and society in a great way.
We hope that nothing will dim your vision as you look forward to
a much larger field of service.
Southern Missionary College serves all the states comprising
the Southe rn Union. In other words, our community is made up
of the constituents of the several states in our Southern Union.
This poses a problem which a college of a more localized nature
does not have to contend with. No matter how the faculty or the
Board of the College feels, the college must still be concerned
with the feelings of the constituents in the several southern
states. Most of us here at the college have served in several
of our other colle ges which have been integrated for a number of
years. We completely accept the spirit of the policy of the
General Conference but recognize that because of the problems
involved, we cannot move faster than the community which we
serve. Recently I have had the privilege of visiting with Elder
W. S. Banfield, president of the South Atlantic Conference,
regarding this problem and the progress which is being made.
Elder Banfield understands the problem and is in a position to
counsel the membership of his conference. May I recommend
that you write Elder Banfield in regard to the problem. The
address of the South Atlantic Conference is P. O. Box 9188,
Station B, Atlanta 14, Georgia.
Elder Banfield will explain to you the position that we are in
at this time. May I recommend to you Emmanuel Missionary
