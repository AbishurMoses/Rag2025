Dear Jack:
For some time I have wanted to write to you about the possibility of
teaching at Southern Missionary College. As Joyce is about to finish her
M. A., we feel that it is time to find an opening in one of our schools
where I could teach French and be ag√†in in the service of the denominaticn.
At the present time I am teaching French in the St. Joseph High School.
I have four years of French, divided into six classes. As you no doubt know
the St. Joseph High School is a class A High School and maintains high stand-
ards, and I enjoy teaching there very much. However, having given sixteen
years of service to the Adventist organization, Joyce and I would much prefer
to be in our own organization.
I understand that not too far from Collegedale there is a gcod univer-
sity where I could take advanced work in the modern language area.
I am nresently studying Spanish, and will have sixteen college credit
hours by the end of the second semester. I also nlan to go to Mexico during
the summer to strengthen my speaking knowledge of it and be able to teach it
also if there shonld be a need for it.
You might be interested also to know that both Joyce and I are
certified. She is certified in English and French and I in French and
History and soon will be in Spanish also.
If there should be a vacancy in your school we would like to have
our names placed on your list. It certainly would be a pleasure for us to
work with vou, Jack, in your fine school.
Hoping to hear from you soon, I am
Most sincerely yours,
Cude
