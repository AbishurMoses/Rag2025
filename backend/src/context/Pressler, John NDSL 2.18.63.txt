Mr. John Pressler
1580 Murray Avenue
El Cajon, California
Dear Mr. Pressler:
We were pleased to receive your letter of inquiry and shall try to
answer your questions in regard to a National Defense Student Loan.
We are also pleased to note that you are looking our way for further
training. Our practice restricts student loans to individuals who have
been on our campus at least nine weeks. We are inter√®sted first of all
to discover the student's ability before granting such a loan. If the
freshman student does well on the first nine weeks test, we will gladly
receive his application for a National Defense Loan. Our College
Board limits the loan to $500 per year or $250 per semester. The
interest rate of three per cent does not take effect until the beginning
of the second year after the student has completed his program or quit
school, whichever the case may be. The first payment is not due until
the end of the second year after he will have finished school or quit.
Thereafter a student has ten years in which to repay the loan, although
the school is interested in retrieviag the funds at an earlier date in order
to assist other students. I believe this covers the aspects of the loan
which you would be interested in, but should you have any other questions,
we shall be glad to hear from you.
We are enclosing an application blank which you may use to apply for
admission. After we receive the transcripts of your previous work, and
also recommendations which we will write for, the committee will
immediately process the application. We sincerely hope that we can be
of service to you.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
