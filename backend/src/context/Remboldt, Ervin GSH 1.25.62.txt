Mr. Ervin Remboldt, Administrator
Glendale Sanitarium and Hospital
Glendale, California
Dear Brother Remboldt:
Several of our men graduating from the field of Business
this spring are interested in going iito some phase of
hospital work. One by the name of Ronald Pickel has been
particularly interested in growing up in hospital work which
will lead him eventually to the post of serving in the capacity
of a hospital administrator.
Mr. Pickel has a very fine personality and is most cooperative.
Patients and employees would enjoy having him around and
Ronald would also be glad to follow through on any line of
work which you may have for him. His strong suit is not
necessarily Ã ccounting, although I believe it vould be well
for bim to be introduced to this area al Iso.
Should you have a need for a young man of his caliber, we
would be pleased to hear from you. I believe Ronald has
been in touch with one of your men, perhaps Mr. Dunn.
We are following your plans for the construction of a new
psychiatric building. We wish you much success and of course
we know that you wi1l leave no stone unturned to make Glendale
one of the finest institutions we have.
Perhaps you have received our placement booklet and if you
wish to check on some of the other men who wi1l be graduating,
you will find their pictures in the booklet along with their
qualifications.
Cordially your friend,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
