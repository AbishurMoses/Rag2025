Lynwood Academy
11081 Harris Avenue
Lynwood, California
Dear Brother Parker:
We are pleased to know that Judy Fowler is making out as an English
teacher. She has plenty of personality and I believe she should do very
well.
Inote your interest in a teacher for industrial arts. I believe we have
such an individual graduating this year who would do a good job for you.
Since you have our senior placement brochure, may I direct you to
the mame of Paul Eirich. Paul is a very fine young man with a deep
spiritual experience. He is very much interested in teaching
industrial arts or industrial education and is even anxious to
proceed with advanced work in this field. Since we did not offer a
major in industrial arts, it was necessary for him to secure a major
in another field, but you will note that his first choice of work is
teaching industrial arts. He would also be interested as a dean of
men but this is not a great burning desire.
Paul took some work in industrial arts at the University of Maryland
last summer and just last week expressed the desire to move ahead
in this field. He is a fine Christian young man and I think you would
appreciate him on your staff. I shall speak to Paul about this pos-
sibility and he will undoubtedly write you in the next day or two. If
you have an interest, please let me know or contact Paul Eirich
directly. He resides in Talge Hall.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider

Academic Dean
