Mrs. Joan Holden
Collegedale, Temessee
Dear Joan:
Enclosed is a letter which I wrote to Everett Walters and also copies
of letters which I received from Mr. Walters and Doctor Boldt of the
Regional Office. These letters are self explanatory and it looks to me
as if they are prepared to start working on this matter. In my letter
to Mr. Walters, as you will note, I indicsted that you would be getting
in touch with him also.
Joan I hope you will pursue this matter for your own sake, You may
even wish to write to the Department of Spanish at the University of
Southern California but before you do this, I would write to Mr. Walters.
Iwould suggest to Mr. Walters that he write to the Spanish Depertment
if he feels that the govermment should take a band in this matter. In the
meantime I feel that Paul should reimburse you for the past year. I
sincerely hope that something comes out of this to your advantage.
From here on it winl be necessary for you to pursue the matter inasmuch
as we will be leaving and the correspondence is hereby turned over to
you. We wish for you a good year here at the academy and I sure in
time matters will work out to your advantage.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
