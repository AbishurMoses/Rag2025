Gentlemen:
I have examined the booklet "A Study of Company-
Sponsored Foundations" which was sent on approval.
After brief examination we feel that it does not
answer our particular interest, and are therefore
returning it.
We appreciate your courtesy and are sorry that
it does not meet our need.
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
