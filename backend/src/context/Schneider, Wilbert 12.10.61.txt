Mr. Wilbert M. Schneider
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Wilbert:
Thank you for your letter of Dec cember 8 which arrived at
the office this morning. I certainly appreciate the information
that you passed on. I chatted with Brother Foster about it this
morning, and it seems that he had checked with Doctor. Kennedy in
regard to this chap mentioned as well. as some others at the be-
ginning of the year. And since Doctor Kennedy didn't mention it,
we were not aware of the situation. There is not much way for us
to surmise thes√© problems unless they are passed on to us.
Brother Foster is going to work with Frank concerning this
problem, and it will be taken care of as conditions indicate.
It was certainly good to see you again while we were in
Miami, and I enjoyed our round of golf together. Instead of selling your
clubs, I think you ought to add to them and get a complete set and try to
get out every week. There is nothing that takes the place of practice in
helping you to enjoy and improve your game.
It is indeed a pleasure to work with you in any way we can,
and we wish for you and your family God's richest blessings as you face the
New Year.
Cordially your brother,
MEA
E. L. Marley
