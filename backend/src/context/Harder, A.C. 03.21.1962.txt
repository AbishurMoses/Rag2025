Route 1, Box 147
Shafter, California
Dear Uncle Abe and Aumt Mary:
We were pleased to receive a clipping of the Shafter Press in
which the press gave coverage to the reunion of your family. We
wish it had been possible to have seen Neander and family on their
way west. I an sure that this is a delightful occasion for
and aunt Mary. Please give all the children our kindest
you
and best wishes.
regards
Perhaps it wili be possible for us to stop at Shafter for a
at the time of the General Conference next summer. We will want day
to see all of you good friends before coming east again.
Time is fast zunning out in this old worid and it does seem that
soon our Saviour will come. At that time we hope it will be our
pleasure to unite with all of our relatives and friends never to
be parted again.
Dad had a rather severe heart attack a few weeks ago but seems to
be getting along as well as can be expected.
Please extend my kind greetings to aunt Nettie and uncle Jake and
also aunt Martha and any others who live in your area. We wi1l
see you again next summer the Lord willing-
Cordially your friends,
Wi lbert M. Schneider
