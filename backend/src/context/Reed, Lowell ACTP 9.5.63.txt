Dear Jack :
As always it was good to hear from you, and I appreciate
your kind remarks.
Would it be possible for you to send me a list of the
principals and names of your feeder high schools? Oluf
Davidsen, our Vice President of Operation, and I are
anxious to see that your project using ACT Tests is
launched successfully. We have been thinking about trying
to establish procedures that can be used by both Andrews
University and Southern Missionary College. This does not
mean there will be any changes at this time. We are looking
not only at the present, but at the future.
Sincerely yours,
Cucll
