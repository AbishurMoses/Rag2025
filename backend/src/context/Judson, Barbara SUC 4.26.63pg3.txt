Mrs. Barbara Judson (Contd)

Thank you again for your letter and if you can explain the situation
to the other individual who wrote anonymously, we will appreciate
your efforts. If it is at all possible for you to come to the campus,
we will gladly sit down for a good visit concerning this problem and
others also. Before leaving Noel came to this office twice to express
a word of appreciation and I fe√®l he was sincere. May the good Lord
help us all to work together toward the common goal of saving souls.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
