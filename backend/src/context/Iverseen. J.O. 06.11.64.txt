Dear Elder Iversen:
Elder Roy Leiske, President of the Ceorgla-Oumberland Conference,
informs me that you will be one of the speakers for the camp meeting
to be held here in Collegedale.
I would like to invite you to speak at our summer chapel program on
June 24 at 6:35 P.m. Our summer school students are comprised
largely of teachers and I am sure they would enjoy having the opportunity
of hearing you while you are in this area.
I trust you will find it possible to meet this appointment. You would
have approximately twenty-five to thirty minutes. The choice of a
topic is entirely up to you.
I shall look forward to seeing you again.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
