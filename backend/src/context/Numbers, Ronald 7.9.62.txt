Oak Ridge, Tennessee
Dear Ronnie:
I am assuming that you have already received a letter from
President Rees in regard to your status next year. Believe
me, Ron, in looking forward to the year you are going to
experience mixed feelings because of the great responsibility
that will rest on your shoulders as President of the Student
Association. I wi1l want to work closely with you in regard
to several aspects of the program.
First of a1l, we are scheduling a social hour for the freshmen
and other students that may be on the campus on Tuesday,
September 11 at 7:30. P.M. In our orientation program we have
listed this social hour as being sponsored by the Student
Association. You will, of course, work with your chief social
officer in working out the details of this program. Also you
will want to work elosely with your advisor, Mr. Kenneth Davis,
in regard to the nature of the program to be presented.
This program wi1l be scheduled for the Lynn Wood Ha11 Chapel,
but of course you may wish to take the group out for a traditional
cantaloupe feed following the program which you will present in
the chapel. I trust that the program will be original inter-
taining but without some of the slapstick comedy that sometimes
finds its way into a social affair. Certainly we can have humor
without slapstick comedy.
I just want to take this opportunity in extending a welcome to
you and also to tell you that we are only too anxious to work
closely with you in making next year a genuine success. If hext
year is not successful, we must a1l share in the responsibility
of its failure. By working together I an sure that we can make
it an outstanding year. I am also anxious to get some of the
speakers lined up for our lecture series. We should work through
the chairman of that committee but it is getting late and we should
be assembijng suggestions for this area of the associations
