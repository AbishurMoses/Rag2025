Mr. John D. Rhodes
3631 Harding Street
Long Beach, Califoria
Dear Brother Rhodes:
We sincerely appreciate your interest in Joining our Bible
Depa rtment staff on this campus. We also appreciate the
receipt of your transcript and service records.
As of a year ago, we could have had a sincere interest in
you. However, at this time we have already engaged Elder
Douglas Bennett who is presently working on his Bd. Degree
at Andrews University. Elder Bennett will be joining our
staff in September of next year as a replacement for Elder
Reeves.
Our staff will be complete as of next year, but in another
yeas it is possible that the head of our department will
be retiring and this of course will make it necessary to
secure additional personnel. We sha1l surely keep your
name at the top of the list and if at that time you are still
available, we shall review the matter again. Thank you
sincerely for writing us.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
