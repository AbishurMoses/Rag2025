SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTIST THEOLOGICAL: SEMINARY
SYSTEMATIC THEOLOGY
w. G. C. MURDOCH
July 22, 1958
Dr. G. E. Shankel
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tenn.
Dear Dr. Shankel:
I visited with Elder C. A. Reeves last evening, and he told
me that he had been in touch with you relative to the possibility
of an opening in your Bible department at S.M.C.
I thought you might like to have a little more detail about
Elder Reeve's recent study program. He has an M.A. and a B.D. from
the Seminary. Both of these were given with distinction. I think
his grades were practically "A" throughout. He received a Canadian
Massey Fellowship to the American University for his doctorate. I
believe he has completed the work for this with the exception of
three or four hours. This is in the department of education and
psychology although his special field has been preaching and theo-
logy.
If you are thinking of calling Elder Reeves, I feel sure
you would not make a mistake. I know he would make a distinct
contribution to any college.
He has received a call from the General Conference to connect
with the New Jersey Conference, but his wife's health is such that
she needs a drier climate.
We trust that Mrs. Shankel, Virginia, Harvey and your good
self are all well. We will look forward to seeing you up this way
sometime again.
Sincerely yours,
MsDudek

New Jersey camp meeting.
