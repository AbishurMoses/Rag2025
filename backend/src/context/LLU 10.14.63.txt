Dear Miss Culpan:
I had a letter recently from Harold N. Mozar, M.D., the director of
the Division of Public Health and Tropical Medicine at Loma Linda
University.
He states that Doctor Jack D. Zwemer will be on our campus either
October 24 or 25 to discuss the curriculum of their division in the
field of Public Health. He said they would be grateful for any opportunities
that we could offer Doctor Zwemer that day to present their program dn
Public Health and the opportunities for health educators to members of
the faculty and to the student body.
It does not appear that we will be able to use Doctor Zwemer in a
chapel so I was wondering if you would be able to use him in any of
your classes. He mentioned that Doctor Zwemer had just returned:
from East Africa where Loma Linda University has been conducting
a course for health assistants for the last two years.
If you have any ather suggestions where we might use Doctor Zwemer,
please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
