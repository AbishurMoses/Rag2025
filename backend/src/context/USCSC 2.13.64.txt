Dear Mr. McConnell:
We are very anxious to make our student body and faculty members
aware of the broad range of career opportunities with the Federal
Government. In polling our graduates, however, we were unable
to find any significant interest this year. I imagine this is because
most of them seek employment within the structure of the church
that supports the college. This varies from year to year, however,
and there is a good chance that we will have considerable more
interest next year.
We certainly do appreciate your willingness to visit our campus
and we shall lookiforward to the opportunity of having you visit us
next year. I do appreciate the Federal Career Directory which you
sent to me. I have made this available to the students through the
counseling office. In the event of any inquiries, we will direct these
to you.
Very sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean

Dear Mr. Cassell:
Thank you for your letter of January 14, 1964. In view of your
comments indicating a lack of interest, we will not schedule a
visit to your campus this year. If you should find later that
there is sufficient interest to warrant a visit by a Civil Service
Representative, please let me know.
I am really curious as to whether the student body and faculty
members are aware of the broad range of career opportunities with
the Federal Government today. I am enclosi ing for your information
a copy of the current Federal Career Directory which lists
those jobs which would normally be filled with college graduates. only
The wide variety of positions offers a challenge to graduates in
every major field of study.
I am looking forward to visiting your campus on another occasion.
Sincerely yours,
H. L. MCCONNELL
