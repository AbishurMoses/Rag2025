Dear Doctor Henderson:
While Academic Dean at Emmanuel Missionary College, Berrien
Michigan, for three years, it was my pleasure to attend several of Springs, the
conferences sponsored by the University of Michigan. Although
the work of a schoo1 administrator, I accepted an invitation from enjoying a
firm in the state of California to serve as treasurer and chief financial business
officer. In this capacity I served for two years; however, it is difficult
for an educator to erase the experience of 18 years in the fiel 1d of
education.
At the present time I am academic Dean of Southern Missionary
and, of course, I an interested in devoting my services to the field College, of
education. Before being asked to occupy the position of Academic Dean at
Emmanuel Missionary College; I taught in the field of economics and business
administration. My doctoral program was in the field of economics. At
this time I am interested in sharpening my tools as an administrator, and
your fe 1lowship program designed to prepare better administrators has
sparked my interest.
Wi1l you kindly send me an application blankc with additional information
concerning the progran. In other words, what chances are there of such a
fellowship for the school year 1961-62 or possibly the following year? At
present, I am 42 years of age with most of my service years still ahead.
Thank you for any information which you may send in regard to the
program outlined in your brochure.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
