Dear Harriet:
Recently Doctor Clark and I have been planning a series of
chapel programs in comemoration of the Civil Wax. We realize
the care that has to be exercised to avoid any flare up of
prejudice feelings, but it would be well to review aspects of
this period of American History lest we Forget the tragedy
tha t occurred to the nation at that time.
The chapel dates set aside for this purpose are April 9, 11,
and 13. The division meetings scheduled for the chapel period
of April 13 have been moved to April 20.
On Saturday night, April 14, the Student Association has the
permission to schedule a benefit program. Doctor Clark and I
have beent thinking that it would be a good idea to build Ã 
program around the Civil War scene which could be used for
benefit puxposes. We be lieve that the progran could be of
Such a caliber as to attract a Jarge number of people. Doctor
Clark is ancious to work with you on this idea if you should
find it acceptable. We, of course, hesitate to use too many
films in asmchas there are few good ones available. Doctor
Clark has some ideas which he would be willing to discuss with
you. As soon as you arrive on the campus, your may wish to see
Doctor Clark in rega rd to the possibilities of organizing a
number one program for this occasion. We would all certainly
stand behind you and give you a1l the assistance necessary.
Very sincerely yours,
Wil Ibert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
