Dear Brother Johmson:
We wish it vere possible for aS to have on tap individuals
to qualify for a1l the calls which we receive from day to day.
English teachers, of course, are just about as scarce as tzees
on the desert. We do have one suggestion to make. Mr. Steve
Ward. 5801 Kalmia Street, Springfield, Vixginia did not gradu-
ate from here but took at least one year at a State Teachers
College in North Carolina. Mr. Ward is the son of a colporteur
in the North Carolina Conference. He is precently teaching in
a high school in Springfieid, Virginia but has expressed the
desire to join up with one of ouz academies.
I believe he would be we1l qualified to teach English and any
thing in the social studies. He has had a total of twenty-six
hours of Faglish and some graduate work. He graduated in the
top ten of his class.
I do not Inow Steve personally but his letter to me expressed
a genuine desize to get into one of our denominational schools.
Should you have a desize to secure his services, you may redchss
him at the above address.
Thanks for the invitation and we hope in the future we can be
of more help. to you.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi Ibest M. Schneider
Academic Dean
