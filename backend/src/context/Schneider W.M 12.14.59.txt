Dear Mr. Sweet:
President Rees has asked me to complete the form which you
sent him under date of December 3.
We do not do very extensive work in any of the categories
listed in this questionnaire. I have indicated our Summer
field trips under the classification of extension classes
even though they do not strictly fall ander such a description.
I have included them under that heading since it most nearly
applies to the courses which we offer in colonial history
and biology. We do not offer these courses every summer but
on somewhat of an altermating basis. These courses are three
weeks in length and carry either two or three semester hours
credit.
Trusting the information given will be sufficient for the
purpose of the questionnaire, I am
Very sin√ßerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
Jr
