Dear Dean Schneider:
Eight of my students failed freshman composition last semester.
All are happily enrolled in the second semester of the course, although
I understand that this is contrary to the policy here, and rightly SO.
Whose responsibility is it to ask these students to leave class?
I confess I don't relish the idea of doing it myself, and would be
delighted to hear that it is someone else's duty.
These are the students involved:
VVictor Calfee
Willard Campbell
/Windell Driskell
V John Goodbrad
CJames Pierce
Allen Robinson
Ld. Samuel Small
/Donald Townsend
What shall be done with them? Thank you for your advice.
Yours sincerely,
fanh
