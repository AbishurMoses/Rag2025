Dear Mr. Long:
Thank you for your inquiry of recent date. On the matter of
scholarships, Imay say that we do have sma1l forms of
assistance for a number of students but not too many. We
have Colporteur Scholarships and for those who are preparing
for elementary teaching. We have a few amounts coming in
throughout the year that we apply to the students accounts,
but usually not more than $100 to a student.
Under the National Defense Act, there will be quite a number
of loans of $250 a year; and we also have an Alumni Loan
Fund of. $1200 to $1500 a year from which appropriations are
made to students as outright gifts. We have other sma1l
scholarship funds. However, they are not more than $100 to
$250 a year. The main thing is that as far as our assistance
is concerned, we help a number of students, as I say, with
sma1l amounts if they prove themselves worthwhile and good
students.
That is about as definite as I can be on the matter. I hope
this answers your question and that we may hear from you
further. I am
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shanke1
