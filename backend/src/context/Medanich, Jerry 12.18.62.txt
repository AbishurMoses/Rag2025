Tallahassee, Florida
Dear Mr. Medanich:
We are sorry that we seem to be unable to come up with
a suitable person that would serve you as a medical librarian.
These people are very scarce and may prove hard to get.
I believe that Loma Linda with La Sierra College has started
a program leading to a medical librarianship. It may be that
you could contact Loma Linda and get additional information
from there as to the availability of a lady for this field.
Thanks for calling on us and if we hear of anyone that could
serve you or be trained for your job, we will surely get in
touch with you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
