REGIONAL CHAIRMAN
NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE 37203
13 April 1964
Dear. Campus Representative:
I should like to thank you all for your support in what has proven a success-
ful year for our region. Now that interest is high on our campuses, perhaps
we should give thought to encouraging nominations for the fall, when other
activities tend to impede our efforts.
Let me suggest. that you consider calling together all promising sophomores
and juniors, giving them an idea of the Program's aims and, perhaps, asking
one of the most effective and congenial of your colleagues to give a short
talk on college teaching. A tea afterwards, with one or two representatives
of your Administration, might serve to indicate institutional support of the
Program.
Once more, congratulations on a job well done. I think the greatest reward
our Committee receives is the opportunity to meet and talk with these fine
young people you so carefully pick. We all much appreciate your wisdom and
judgment and we look forward to an equally pleasant experience next year.
Sincerely yours,
-
Raypond P. Poggenburg
