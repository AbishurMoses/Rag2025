Dear BAll:
I was not previously aware of the foundation mentioned in the clipping
you sent to me recently. I checked with Bill Taylor and he was not
aware df it either, but both of us are very definitely interested.
Bill wanted me to tell you that he is also interested in this gentleman
who gives nursing scholarships to our girls on the Orlando campus.
I would also like to get further information on Mr. Blount and the
foundation mentioned in the news paper article. Since you know
Mr. Long personally, I wish you would get as much information as
possible from him and pass it along to us. I think a contact with
Mr. Blount would be in order unless he channels this money into some
particular denomination.
We certainly appreciate you bringing this to our attention for we are
looking for any and all contacts with foundations that we can make.
Bill has our prospectus to press now and it should be available in a
few weeks. I have seen the preliminary drawings on it and feel that
it will be very attractive and very valuable to us in making contacts
with various corporations and foundations.
Hope everything is going well with you and if you find out any more
about this foundation, please let us know.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
