Dear Brother Park:
We aze pleased to recommend to you the name of John Siemens
for the teaching of the biological sciences. John is an
exceptional student and of course is very mat ture because of
his age. John would make an exceptional teacher if permitted
to serve in that capacity.
We recognize that John, because of a lack of educational
subjects, is not prepared for certification at this tine,
but of course he could secure several hours of education this
sumer and it may be that he could attend the University of
Southern California during the evening hours in order to secure
more hours in the field of edycation. Of course I feel that
John will be able to do as good a job in teaching now as he will
be after securing his work In the field of education.
Frankly we feel that John is one of the better students and wi1l
do excellent work in the graduate study. should he pursue work
leading to the master's degree.
You will also find Mrs. Siemens a delightful lady and they have
two very fine young boys. We hope you wili be able to use John
in your progzam there at Orangewood. You wi1l appreciate John
on your staff.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schne ider
Academic Dean
