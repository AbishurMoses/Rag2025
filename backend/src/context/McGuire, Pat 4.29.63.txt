Dear Pat:
The record of Richard Fisher shows a fairly good scholastic level
of achievement and there is nothing on the record that would influence
us to question his acceptability as a salesman for your company. In
the salesmanship class he received a grade of "A". His over all
scholastic record is approximately a "B-".
I have spoken to Mr. Wayne VandeVere, head of our Business
Department, concerning this man but he is not genuinely acquainted
with the fellow. Mr. Fisher's last year was Mr. VandeVere's first
year at this school and he states that he had him in only one class..
Perhaps you will have to judge Mr. Fisher on the merits of his
service since he has finished college. We hope that he will become
a successful salesman for your company.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
