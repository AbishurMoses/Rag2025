Angwin, California
Dear Doctor Mathisen:
My attention has been called to the fact that several
colleges and universities in our part of the wozld are
not accepting transfer grades of "D's" regardless of the
issuing institution. There seems to be some merit in such
a policy and I am personally wondering what our own college
deans think of such a policy for our oum fustitutions.
A grade level of "D" is of little value and so often a
tender hearted teacher gave the grade when actually an
"p" would have been in order. This is not alays true,
but certainly eaperience has taught this lesson. We
are not at this time prepared to indicate what we would
do in regard to such a policy, but I am sonewhat persuaded
in that direction. Let me know what you think of such a
policy.
Very sincerely yours,
Wi lbert M, Schneider
