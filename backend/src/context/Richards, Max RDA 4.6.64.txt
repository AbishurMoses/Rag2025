Dear Mr. Richards:
Southern Missionary College is participating in the chartered flight
arrangements made with you by Mr. Desmond Cummings, youth leader
of the Southern Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists at 437 B. Ponce
De Leon, Decatur, Georgla.
A number of the youth in the Cummings group will be directed by Doctor
Gordon M. Hyde, chairman of our Communications Department, and they
will be granted college credit for the tour -study in Europe under his
direction.
This is our first venture in this direction and its success will confirmi our
desire to make such tours a regular feature of our academic program. One
difficulty which we face is in connection with Doctor Hyde's travel arrange-
ments. He will want to travel from New York to Amsterdam with the group
on July 14, but we need to have him remain in England about three weeks
beyond the date for the return of the group on August 17. This need grows
out of the fact that Doctor Hyde's 92 year old mother is living in England
and, since he has not seen her for 12 years, we are anxious that he be given
the opportunity to spend some three weeks with her after the group tour is
over.
Our question to you is this: Can you do anything to facilitate Doctor Hyde's
return from London to New York on or about September 7, 1964? Can you
possibly provide a reservation for him, and if 80, what would be the additional
fare beyond the round trip group fare which Mr. Cumlaings has arranged
with you?
We should be most grateful for any helpful information which you could
provide on this items.
Very sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
