Dear Brother Duffield:
We sincerely appreciate your inquiry regarding the availability
of young ladies trained in the field of accounting. The young
lady, Sandra Vinson, whom you mentioned in your letter, would
qualify but we are not certain at the moment what she plans to
do. Mr. L. L. Dunn of the Glendale Sanitarium and Hospital
has been on our campus and it is entirely possible that he will
wish to take both Sandra Vinson and Martha Silver, a graduate
of last year presently working in our Business Office, to the
Glendale Sanitarium. Bither one of the two young ladies would
do well and we would not hesitate to recommend then without
reservation. Perhaps it would be we1l for you to write Sandra
immediately if you wish her services.
We have a number of fine young men graduating from the fields
of Business Administration and Accounting who would be in a
position to serve your institution very acceptably. The following
are individuais that I can recommend who le heartedly: Kenneth
Straw, Robert Hanson, Joe Green, James Culpepper, Jon Gepford,
Wesley Paul, and perhaps still others. Some whose names I have
not mentioned are planning to enter the private field of accounting.
If we can be of any farther help to you, please let us hear from
you soon.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
