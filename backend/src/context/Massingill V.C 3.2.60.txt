Mr. V. C. Massingill
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Massingill:
We missed you at Sabbath School this last Sabbath.
I hope you have not been ill.
We are making a very definite attempt to enroll as
many of our church members in the Sabbath School as
possible this quarter, and I should like to encourage
you'to be present every Sabbath if at all possible so as
not only to receive, but also to share with the rest of
us the blessing of your presence.
I hope you have not been 111, and furthermore, I
hope to see you in my class this next Sabbath.
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
