REGIONAL CHAIRMAN
VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY
NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE 37203
October 5, 1964
Dear Campus Representativ:
Now that the senester, quarter, trimester or term has gotten
under way, I hope we may all turn our attention to this year's Woadrow
Wilson National Fellowship Foundation competition.
Let ne urge once again that you bend every effort in the search
for absolutely outatanding candidates. Since this means reminding our
colleagues, let us be especially active now, in our publicising of the
progran.
A few matters should be mentioned. We some times overlook the
fact that a candidate will, if successful, become a teacher. His traits
of character and personality thus become of interest to us at this stage
and letters of reference ought to include observations on these aspects.
As last year, we shall ask each candidate to provide evidence of
his reading knowledge of one foreign language through a short written
examination after interviow. In doubtful cases the results will be
consulted and could assune some importance.
Each nominator should speak with his nominee about his interest
in a professorial career before the nanes are sent to the regional
chairman.
We of the regional committee look forward with pleasure to the
year ahead, largely because you have shown such energy, good will and
shrewdness in your efforts on behalf of our progran. I thank you for
what you have done and an already grateful for what you will do.
Cordially yours,
OR8
Ragond P. Poggeburg
RÃ©gional Chairman
P. S. October 31, 1964 is the nomination deadline.
