Tennessee Incustrial Research Advisory Service

Nasiville, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Harris:
E
Doctor Rees has asked me to answer your letter of July 29 in which you
request information concerning technological and scientific programs
at Southern Missionary College.
Southern Missionary College is basically a liberal arts college, but of
course we do offer a full complement of courses in the science areas.
We do not endeavor to offer many courses in the technological areas,
however. Iam sending a copy of our Icurrent bulletin under separate
cover which I think will fully explain the degrees, majors, and courses
available in these areas.
If we can be of further service to you, please feel free to contact us.
Very sincerely yours,
J.W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean

Dr. C.N. Rees, President
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Rees:
In preparation for a State Scienc e and Technology Conference to
be held in Washington, D.C. during September, under the sponsorship
of the National Bureau of Standards and the Washington Board of Trade,
this office is working in conjunction with the Governor's Staff
Division for Indus trial Development to gather information about the
capability of the state of Tennessee in science and technology. One
of the areas about which we have been asked to gather information
concerns the capability of institutions of higher education in the
field of science and technology. Each state which will participate
in the conference has been requested to provide information about
the institutions of higher learning within the state as f'ollows :
1. Areas of outstanding attainment in science and
technology.
2. Other areas of competence in science and technology.
3. A statistical profile, to cover the following points:
a. Number of faculty, as of June 1964.
b. Number of students, as of June 1964
C. Number and field of baccalaureate and advanced
degrees, total for academic year 1963-64.
You will note that the material which we have been asked to supply
for this conference is much broader than that which we have gathered
in support of the TIRAS program; for the purpos es of this compilation,
a brief description of the overall scientific and technological
capacity of each ins ti tution is required.
In order to meet the deadline for compiling information about
Tennessee's colleges and universities, we will need a response from
you not later than August 12. Your cooperation in meeting this date
will be greatly appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
-
CLAR
Reuben E. Harris
