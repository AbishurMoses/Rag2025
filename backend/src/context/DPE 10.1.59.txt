Gentlemen:
I am endeavoring to gather a more or less complete file
of information on financial aid to students on the
undergraduate level. I have an adequate list of books
of available scholarships and fellowships on the graduate
level and am anxious to supplement this with undergraduate
level materials.
I of course have your material in the fields of medical
and allied fields, also the Danforth, National Science,
Foundation, and Woodzow Wilson as we1l as the National
Defense Student Loan plan, but I am Sure there are a
number of other scholarship plans.
If you do not have information on these, possibly
you can refer me to some source that would be helpful
in furnishing such information.
I shall appreciate any suggestions you may be able to
offer.
Yours very truly,
G. E. Shankel
