Dear Mrs. Necker:
Iappreciate your recent letter inquiring as to the opportunities for
tÃ©aching positions in the area of public schools. I would suggest that you
write to Dr. Sam McConnell, Superintendent of County Schools, Hamilton
County Court House, Chattanooga, Tennessee and Dr. Benjamin Carmichael,
Superintendent of Chattanooga City Schools, 1161 W. 40th Street, Chattanooga,
Tennessee, regarding teaching positions in the area. I am fairly confident
you would be able to find employment quite readily, due to your many years
of experience.
I am enclosing an application blank with this letter in the event that
your daughter would like to apply to Southern Missionary College.
If you should have any further question or if I may be of any
assistance to you, please feel free to contact me.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell
Academic Dean
