February 4, 1959
Miss Flora Savelle
307 East King Avenue
Orlando, Florida
Dear Miss Savelle:
It was nice to hear from you again in your letter of February
1. Yes, it would be a great pleasure to take a group on another
field trip--only next time I think I would like to go on a
bus so we could all be together.
Regarding the color slides of the various places, it would
be rather difficult for me to know just what you want. Hence,
I an enclosing a 1ist of the places where we visited of which
I have color slides. If you will indicate the ones you
wish to have, I will have them made for you. Their price
has gone up slightly since the field trip. I think they
cost some 30 cents apiece, but that is not a large amount.
As far as California is concerned, I have very little of
any value. I have quite a few of the Northest--Oregon
and Mashington--but not too much of California, so I an afraid
I cannot accommodate you on that.
We are having a very fine year at Southern Missionary College
and we certainly hope that you are likewise having a good
year.
I see I neglected to answer the question you asked in your
last paragraph. A11 the pictures I have are 35-mm slides
and are used with a projector. I do not have any filn strips.
I shall be glad to label each one so that you will have no
difficulty in identifying them.
With very kindest regards, I am
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
