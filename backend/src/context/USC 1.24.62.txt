Dear Madam:
Mr. Paul Holden is making application to your institution and
specifically to your department for admission as a graduate student
with the hope of securing a scholarship or fe1 1lowship grant under
the National Defense Bducation Act. Mr. Holden will be completing
his work on our campus this spring.
We would be delighted to have Mr. Holden continue his work at your
university. He is worthy of every consideration and would do very
we1l as a graduate student in the field of languages. Even now he
is considered a linguist and is capable of using several languages.
Paul has been a good scholar on our campus and as he secures
additional work on the graduate level, he should prove to be a
real asset in the training of linguists. Because of the stress
which our national government is placing on this aspect of the
training program, we recommend Mr. Holden to you without reser-
vation. We. sincerely hope that he wi1l-be able to secure a
fellowship so very much needed in his case inasmuch as he has a
wife and two children. Thank you for every consideration.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
