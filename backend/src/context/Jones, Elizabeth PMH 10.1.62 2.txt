as Hinsdale, Glendale or almost any of the nursing schools
not locat ted in the Southern Union. If you chose, you could
make application to any of the other colleges with the thought
of taking your pze nursing there and transferring to a school
of nursing later. From your letter I have not been able to
ascertain hethes you are interested in a four-year collegiate
nursing progran ora three year program leading to the RN. It
may be that you wish to proceed with the RN program. In that
case, I would xecommend Emmanuel Missionary College which is
affiliated with the Hinsdale Senitarium OE you could transfer
to the Glendale Sanitarium oE possibly to most any of the others.
You could secure a four-year program by going to Union College
which is affiliated with the Porter Sanitarlum and Hospital in
Denver. There is aiso the Columbia Union College School of
Nursing affiliated with the Washington Sanitarium and Hospital.
One could also go to La Sierra College and from there go to
Glendale oF to the Loma Linda School of Nursing.
We are very sorry that we cannot be of any immediate help to
you at this time. We are certain, however. that you wi1l be
able to achieve your goal within the near future.
Very sincerely yours,
wilbert M. Schneider
