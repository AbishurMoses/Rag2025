Miss Evelyn Rittenhouse
Secretarial Science Department
Walla Walla College
College Place, Washington
Dear Miss Rittenhouse:
It was a pleasure to have the opportunity to talk with you on the phone
the other evening. I trust I did not give an impression that we were in
anyway trying to place any undue pressure upon you to make a decision.
Of course since Mr. Read is planning to connect with Pacific Union
College, we do have a very important vacancy that we need to fill as
quickly as possible.
We believe that we have a very excellent Secretarial Science program
now in operation at Southern Missionary College. Consequently, we
believe that we must have the best leadership in this department. We
cannot think df anyone who could give better leadership than you could.
I know the Lord will guide you in making this decision and that you
will be directed to serve in the place where you can make the greatest
contribution. It would be a great pleasure to have the opportunity of
working with you here at Southern Missionary College.
We shall look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
