Dear Brother Cassell:
You letter of Aug. 4 somehow evaded me until today,
my apologies.
I believe it would be best if I were designated re-
presentative for the ACT testing program. I think that
I probably have more training and experience in testing
than any of my teachers.
I agree that it would be good for every senior to
take the test and we will require it as part of the school
program. I will be very happy to work with you in this
program and will enjoy visiting with you at your convenience.
With every good wish, I am
