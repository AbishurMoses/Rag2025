who could have helped you more than I.

Jre, scademic dean, snd Mr. C. F. W. Futcher, ouz director of
admissions and records, a sking then to send you a bulletin and
application blanks just as soon as possible.
You can check in the industrial education depertment section
of the bulletin to see what is offered in graphic arts, and
you can also look at theology.
Quite a few have been accepted for stuner claes work to see how
they wi11 fit into a college progran, taking one subject here
