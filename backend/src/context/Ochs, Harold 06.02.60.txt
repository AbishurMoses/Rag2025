Dear Sir:
I wish to inquire concerning two of your graduates of this
year, Ann Cunningham and Esther Tyler.
At this late date we are still searching for a librarian
at Columbia Academy, Battleground, Washington. Doctor Walters
of Walla Walla College suggested I inquire concerning these
two girls.
Tf they are not already employed and are interested in
librarian work and part time teaching, probably in the field
of English, would you please send me additional information
on them so that they might be considered by the Columbia Acad-
emy Board.
Sincerely,
Masack 20cke
Harold T. Ochs,
Principal Elect of Columbia Academy
