Route 2, Box 898
Asheville, North Carolina
Dear Bob:
I have already completed the recommendation form
and sent it on to the proper person. I was happy
to do this.
I am only Sorry that your scholastic record was
not higher so that we could give a strong
recommendation on the scholastic part. But as
far as the other things were concerned we were
only too happy to rate you highly on cooperation
and general citizenship. We are always happy
to serve our former students and especially
those who had a good record in the college Such
as you have.
With very kind regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean
