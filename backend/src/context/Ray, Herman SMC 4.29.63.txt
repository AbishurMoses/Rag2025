Dear Dr. Schneider:
In your last communi cation to e concerning my gredua te work,
you suggested that I write to you again prior to the college board
meeting May 8th at which time you would prese ent my request.
Just to refresh your memo FY, it will be two sumer school Bessions
and another semester of night classes such as I am doing this S emes ter--
a three-hour claso on Mond lay evenings.
The only work conc ern as I ses it at the moment would be a few days
in the chaplainte office betvgen Elder hecvets return from vacation
in June and the beginning of the summer sess ion on June 17. This
can be coverat isome way I am sure.
I would appreciate your letting me know as soon as the board has
taken wha tever action they see best so I can make plans for any
future enrollement at Stetson University.
It was a pleasure to ha ve you on the Crlando campus and to
have a renewal of the inspiration you always bring with you.
Singerely yours,
