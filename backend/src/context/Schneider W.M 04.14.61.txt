Dear Stanley:
Thank you kindly for your letter of April 11, in
which you are requesting some assurance that I would
agree to a confidential arrangement on some matter which
you wish to communicate to me. This I am always glad to
do, and, if I consider it unwise to proceed with wha tever
request is lodged, I sha1l simply state so and keep the
matter personal.
We hope you are finding your work interesting at
EMC and, of course, profitable. We enjoyed EMC during our
five-year stay there, but have learned to appreciate it
here also.
We will be awaiting word from you at some later date.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

Dear Dr. Schneider:
There is something of a personal nature which I
would like very much to communicate to you and
obtain your counsel on. However, I would like
some as surance that the matter could remain be-
tween the two of us until a later date. Do you
think this would be a possibility?
I would apprec: iate hearing from you at some early
convenience, if possible.
Thank you.
Sincerely yours,
Stanley K. $howalter
