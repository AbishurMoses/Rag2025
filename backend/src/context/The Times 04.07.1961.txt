Dr. Wilbur Schneider
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dr. Schneider:
Just a note to thank you for the splendid time which I had at
Southern Missionary College last Tuesday. I certainly appreciate
the courtesy which you and other college officials showed me
in outlining the program at the college and explaning future
plans.
You can be assured that the most difficult decision that I perhaps
have ever made was that of declining the invitation to connect
with the college as a teacher in the Department of Theology. As
I mentioned to you, I do enjoy working with young people, and
the program which you folk have at the college is as near to ideal
as any I have known. However, it does seem best for the present,
anyway, to remain here at Southern Publishing Association.
Be assured of our continuing interest in Southern Missionary
College. We do hope that you and the family will be passing
through Nashville sometime in the future and that we will have
the opportunity of visiting with you.
Sincerely,
- A aast
