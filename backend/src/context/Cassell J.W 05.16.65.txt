Deaz Brother Stannard:
Iam writing to you in regard to one of the teachers in your conference
who is planning to attend summer school.
First of all I want to tell you how much we appreciate your support in
sending the church school teachers in the Carolina Conference to
Southern Missionary College. Most of these folks are very dedicated
intelligent people who are not only making a fine contribution to our
work but to our summer program here.
Joseph Langford, who has applied to come here this summer, seems
to be having academic difficulty. He has accumulated 99 hours with
a gzade point average of 1.49. Of course it would not be possible for
us to graduate him until he reaches the 2.0 level. Consequently, we
have serious question as to whether the Carolina Conference will want
to continue financial support.
I felt a responsibility to hring this to your attention since we will
probably not permit him to re-register following this summer unless
he shows definite improvement academically. Iam sure you can
understand our position since we do not want them to accumulate a
large mumber of credit hours without some indication of improvement
academically. Please feel free to share your feelings with me regard-
ing Joseph.
Itrust things are going well for you and that you have been able to fill
your personnel needs for the coming school year. MIcan be of any
assistance to you in any way, please feel free to contact me.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
