Dear Sir:
Gem State Academy is seeking a strong English major or
minor who is interested in taking charge of the library
and teaching one or two English classes. While the
school can make no commitment: S beyond one year we would
look forward to assisting such a person to a library
science degree (M.A.).
We prefer someone who has had at least a basic course
in library science or more. This person must be will-
ing to earn a minimum of twelve quarter hours of credit
in librarianship this summer at our usual summer school
assistance policies. Can you recommend someone to us?
Sincerely
V. JÃ©ters
Associate Professor of Education
(Principal elect) Gem State Academy
P. S. Who might you suggest for band and instrumental
instruction. It looks as though we might have a vacancy
in this area also. Anything in Choral?
Do you have someone who is trained in the new methods
of modern language instruction (German or Spanish). This
person should be acquainted with the use of teaching
ma chine instruction if possible.
