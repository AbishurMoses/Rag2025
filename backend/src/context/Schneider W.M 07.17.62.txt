Dear Mr. Stevens:
We will be pleased to record credit for the first semester
of Organic Chemistry upon completion of the audit arrange-
ment at the University of Chattanooga and the taking of an
examination over the particular area which you were not
examined on at the time you took the course from Doctor
George Nelson.
If you will request your professor to give you this examination
over that particular area and have him commnicate your score
to us, we shall get in touch with Doctor Ne Ison to formulate
a final grade for the entire semester.
Very sincerely yours,
Wil 1bert M. Schneider
Academic Dean

Dear Mr. Stevens:
It wa S nice to receive your letter and to learn that you
are in the teaching profession which can be a missionary
enterprise outside of the denominational organization as well
as within. I as sume that you are continuing your educational
progress in order to be better qualified as a teacher.
In regard to the incomplete in Organic Chemistry for the
fir st semester for the 1954-19 55 year, I think it would be be st
to make application to the Academic Standards Committee
thr ough Dr. Schneider for an acceptable procedure to eliminate
the grade of incomplete. The Committee will have to pass on
any arrangement, sO it would be bes st to get a plan of procedure
from the Committee in the fir st place. You can be assured of
my full CC ooperation with whatever arra angement can be made.
Sincerely,
heloey
George J. Nelson, Ph. D.
