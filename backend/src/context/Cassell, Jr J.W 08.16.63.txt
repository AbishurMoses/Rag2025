Dear Harry:
I am chairman of the Scholarship Committee here and am very
interested in better organizing the application procedure. I wish
you would share with me the forms that you use there for students
applying for National Defense Loans.
I am also interested in the way youpresent these applications to the
committee. I think you developed a sheet giving the necessary
information for the committee to act intelligently. Anything you
could send us in this way would be greatly appreciated.
Things are going well here and I am beginning to see my way through
the mumerous duties that fall to my lot. I believe we are going to have
quite a sizable increase in our enrollment.
Best wishes toyou and many thanks for anything you can send to us.
Sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
