Dear Brother Dunn:
We appreciate your need for one or two secretaries in the
immediate future. I have thought about this matter ever since
your call and wish to make one suggestion. Obviously, secretaries
are hard to get inasmuch as many of them get married and others
leave this area.
We have reason to believe that one of our graduates of two years.
ago is not entirely pleased or happy living on the West Coast.
Martha Silver is presently employed by the Glendale Sanitarium
and Hospital and it may be possible for you to contact her through
the Sanitarium Personnel Manager, Mr. Dunn. Martha graduated
two years ago and stayed with us one year to work in our Business
Office. We employed her with the understanding that she wanted
to try her hand away from home after the one year. Martha was
a good worker and I believe would be an excellent secretary for
your office inasmuch as she has both the secretarial and accounting
training. We were well pleased with her work here at the college.
It has come to our attention that she would prefer this area of the
country. Iwould recommend her without reservation and if it is
true that she desires to return, I would certainly do all to secure
her services. Other than that, we can come up with little else to
suggest. If anything else comes to mind, we shall communicate
with you again.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
