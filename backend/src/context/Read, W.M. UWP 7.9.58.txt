Mr. W. M. Read, Director
University of Washington Press
Seattle 5, Washington
Dear Mr. Read:
Rather bel latedly I must thank you for your letter of May 20.
I have been away much of the time since then.
I have zead with interest the reports of the two readers
and see that a revision embodying the various suggestions
would mean a rather major undertaking, one tehich would require
more time than I an likely to have available at least for a
year.
For the present I have laid aside y work as a history
teacher and have agreed to serve as academic dean to meet
an emergeney situation. I realize that the subject of ny
dissertation is most involved and complicated in nature,
a difficult one to simplify.
I do however value the criticism of your readers and the
consideration you have given. I rather think that a year
from now I may be able to devote time to the revision. I
am only SOFEY that I cannot undertake the revision immediately
and thus be able to utilize the service of the present
readers, but it is quite out of the question to get away
to Canada to secure material for an additional chapter oE
two. I see no recourse except to defer for the present.
Up to now I have not mentioned the question of financial
arrangement. Information on this subject may prove important
if not decisive in my thinking, too. Can you give ne at
least an approximation on this point.
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Ja
Dean
