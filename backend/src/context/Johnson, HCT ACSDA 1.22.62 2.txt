It may be possible for us to attend the Seattle World's
Fair nest summer after the General Conference Session.
Seattle is a long distance from Tennessee, but while we
are in the West, it may be to our advantage to take our
vacation at the same time.
We have a young man from Canada graduating in Business
this year who would very much enjoy going back to Canada
or in some azea of the northwest. Should you have need
of such an individual, please let 115 hear fromt you. I
be lieve that you will find his name and picture iin the
Placement Bulletin.
Write us again and keep us posted on developments in the
Alberta field.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M. Schneider
Academic Dean
