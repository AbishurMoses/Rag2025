Dear Dr. Schneider:
Enclosed are some Publishing Department Career Scholarship
Application Blanks. Once each year the Southern Publishing
Association offers a $300.00 scholarship to a selected young
man or woman who desires to make the Publishing Department his
or her career. This would include work in any publishing activ-
ity such as field leadership, Bible House work, secretarial work
in any office having to do with publishing work, or work in the
Publishing House--in any accounting, secretarial, or editorial
position.
Please be so kind as to announce the availability of this
scholarship during your next chapel period. Have the applicants
fill out the application blanks and return them to you. If you
will mail them to me by December 20, I shall appreciate it very
much.
Very sincerely yours,
-
