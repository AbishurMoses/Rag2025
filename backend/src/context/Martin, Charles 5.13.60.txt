Dear Mr. Martin:
In reply to your letter of May 9 concerning Dr. James
Burton Everett, I may say that he attended our prepar-
atory school one year 1943-44 and finished his last year
of secondary school in our preparatory school,
He did not take any college work here. However, we sent
a transcript of his secondary school work to Walla Walla
College, College Place, Washington where I suppose they
would have his complete record of college work.
Since he was not enrolled in college here, I would not
be in any position to te1l you anything about him and
I do not be lieve there are any teachers in our prepar-
atory school who were here at that time.
Very sincerely yours,
G. E. Shankel
Academic Dean

I would appreciate your evaluation of this man, and of course,
confirmation of the fact that he did attend Southern Missionary College.
Sincerely,
