We still have a need for a qualified piano and organ teacher.
I am wondering if you have such a person either a graduste of this
year or of previous years that is not placed or wishes a change. If
you know of such a person with the necessary educational require-
ment, and that you would recommend, would you send us his or her
name please so we can make contact.
We will appreciate anyil help you can give.
Sincerely yours I
