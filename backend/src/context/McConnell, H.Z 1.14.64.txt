Dear Mr. McComell:
Thank you very much for your letter of January 8. We appreciate
your interest in our students of Southern Missionary College.
I have talked with the heads of various departments and they have
reported that they dont.seem to have any students who are interested
in the Civil Service at this particular time. We are happy to have
you write to us each year and will be happy to cooperate with you in
anyway in arranging appointments with interested students.
Very sincerely yours,
