Dear Friends:
We are desperately in need of an English teacher for this
coming school year. Please let us know if you have names
to suggest. We would prefer a woman, but we wouldn't
hesitate to employ a man.
Please be kind enough to reply immediately if you have
suggestions.
Most sincerely,
K. D. Johnson
President
