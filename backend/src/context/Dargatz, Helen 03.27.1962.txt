Mrs. Helen Dargetz
328 North Western 
Hemet, California
Dear Helen:
Years have passed since we were school mates together at Kern
River Acadeny. Vhile in California two years ago I learned of
your parents that you were living in Hemet. I tas sorry to learn
of the loss of your husband during the last war. I tmderstand that
you now have childres that are about as gzomm up as you were in the
early thirties when we went to school together.
We are presently located here in Collegedale, Tennessee where I am
serving as Academic Dean with Southe mn Missionary College. This is
spring time and the valley is very beautiful. We are enjoying our
work here but of course still apprecia te the west very much. We
hope to drive out to Califomia next sumer for the event of the
General Conference to convene at San Francisco.
We have been very nuich interested in encouraging our early class
mates to continue in the Christian way of life or to zeturn to the
most beautiful experience possible to man. Events are calling our
attention to the climac of al1 things enrthly. It would be such
a joy for a1l of us to meet together in the earth made new. It is
not too late, Helen, and it is with kindness that we wish for you
the happiness that can come to an individuai who has submitted his
will and his all to the Saviour who has paid the infinite price.
We would 1ike to encourage you to experience that abundant 1ife
promised to all of us.
It would be a pleasure to visit with the old class mates but this
perhaps wi1l not be our privilege in this 1ife, but we do so much
hope for that experience in the not too far distant future. As
you find time, it would be a zeal thrill to hear from you.
Very sincerely yours,
Wilbert M, Schneider
AÃ§ademic Dean
