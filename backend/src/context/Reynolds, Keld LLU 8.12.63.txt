Dear Dean Cassell:
I am sure we share an interest in policy and organization
handbooks. It is hoped that we can also share the books with each
other. We have a policy book right off the press, a copy of which
we are sending. We also have personnel handbooks and student
handbooks, in case you are interested. Less pretentious, but
equally important to us, is the organization Handbook, in which
all major administrative positions are described in job analyses.
A new one will be out shortly, and we will also be sharing this
with you.
Any handbooks or reference tools of this sort which you prepare
and use in your institution, and which you are willing to share
with us will be greatly appreciated.
Cordially yours,
Keld J. Reynolds
