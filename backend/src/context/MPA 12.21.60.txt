Dear Dr. Schneider:
Some of our students are asking questions about entrance
requirements specificly regarding of their taking a foreign
language in the Academy. This is the question. Is it nec-
essary for a student to have a foreign language who is looking
forward to taking a Ba tchlor of Science Degree in business or
secretarial science. We unders tand that if they do not take
it in the Academy that they might thave to t ake it in college.
After reading the bullitin we somewhat convinced of that, but
I want ted to ruling on it from you sO that I will know exactly
how to council the young people.
Please let me know by ret turn mail.
Sincerely yours,
MEMoar
M. E. Moore
