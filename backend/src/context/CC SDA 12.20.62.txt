Dear Dr. Schneider:
Your letter of December 7 is much appreciated. We have looked all
over for secretaries and I think now we have finally settled the situ-
ation, however I appreciate very much getting the name of Miss Martha
Silver. If such a time arises, we certainly shall be happy to contact
her, through the Glendal le Sanitarium and Hospital.
Your counsel in this matter has been appreciated. I want you to
know that we appreciate very much what Southern Missionary College is
doing for our son and daughter and our daughter-in-law. It certainly
is a privilege for us to have them there in the school and they do
enjoy it sO much.
May the Lord bless you in your heavy responsibilities throughout
1963. With kindest regards, I am
Sincerely yours,
R. W. Dunn
Secretary-freasurer
