Dear Doctor Cassell:
The latest communication from Dr. Leffler assures me
that there is a chance for me to get my Master's this
summer. Thankyou for your efforts on my behalf.
Perhaps you would like a few particulars about me.
I have a BS Ed. from AUC, and the equivalency of a Master's
degree in hours sO the Atlantic Union has issued me a
professional certificate. I have a permanent certificate
from the University of the State of New York for teaching
in New York State.
My mailing address will be the above until about
June 26 when I will go to Andrews University.
I would like to have my mobile. home moved to College-
dale around the first of September.
It W ould help me budget my finances if I could know
what to expect for the summer. My mother is my dependent
I have one brother but he ass sume: S no responsibility for her ;
financially. He has a large family to support.
I am now looking forward, happily, to teaching at SMC
next year. Again, I do appreciate your interest and enc
ment.
ourage-
Sincerely yours,
Marttazs.
