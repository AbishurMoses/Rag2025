Our very dear Friends,
Just a few lines this morning to say that we
have been happy to have had you in our home and am
wondering about next year.
If you are planning to
remain there another year, we will not go home this
summer but will have what work needs to be done on the
place done by the College.
We have had some really good reports of
the College this year and it rejoices our hearts to
know that God has blessed in such a remarkable
What kind of a winter have you had? The papers ay. here
in California always tell the worst. We have had
some wonderful weather out here, and we have enjoyed
it, but we will be happy to be in our own home
It looks as if we will be here for another year again. or
perhaps until a year from June.
Louis has passed the first part of his board
in surgery and will take the second part in April.
In the mean time while waiting for these
he is taking another board in chest and heart examinations,
He has about decided to return to Bangkok where surgery. he
plans to open a graduate school for training doctors
in their residencies.
We are enjoying being here with our son and
his family but four chil dren really keep us both
busy most of the time.
Wishing you much of God's blessing in
work for Him and the success of the work there, your
I remain, Your sipcere friend. and bpother,
P.S.
I am hoping to have the rogh paved
around the house , but have been waiting to hear
when the College will have some work done and so
have my work done at the same time. In that way I
hope it will be a little less in price.
D.C.L.
