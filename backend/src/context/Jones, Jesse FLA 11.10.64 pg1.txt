Dear Mr. Jones:
After receiving your recent letter relative to a reconsideration of
your zequest for credit for the New England States Tour, I submitted
the matter to the Academic Polieies Committee again. The committee
still feels that it wauld be impossible for us to give you credit for this
tour due to the period af time that has elapsed. However, it was
suggested that a letter from my office stating that you had taken part
in this tour might suffice for certification purposes. Enclosed you
will find a statement to this effect.
Please understand the difficulties we would encounter if we were to
begin to permit students to receive credit for courses they had
audited. Tt is impossible to properly evaluate such an experience,
especially after a period of time had elapsed. I trust the enclosed 8
statement will meet your need for certification renewal.
Very sincerely yours,
J. W. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
