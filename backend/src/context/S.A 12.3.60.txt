Dean Wilbert H. Schneider
Southern Missionary College
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Dean Schneider:
I was very happy to receive your letter of a few days ago and to find
that everything is well with you.
We are anxious to go to Tennessee and see the beautiful country that
surrounds Southern Missionary College. We are eager also to see the
beautiful campus of the college.
Our next six weeks' leave will begin on Thursday, - October 20. If
we leave on that day could you be free on the following day, Friday,
October 21, to see us? I would like to discuss with you a matter
that is of no small importance to me. As we would love to travel
through the beautiful autumn scenery and would like to complete
the trip before really bad weather sets in, this time suits us best.
Will you please write and let us know if we can see you then? We
would also appreciate it if you could reserve a guest room for us
at the college if one is available for Friday evening. If not, we
can make other arrangements. We plan to leave after sundown on
Sabbath for Sunnydale.
Very sin√ßerely,
Richard D. Murphy
Business Education Instructor
