Mr. Bruce Ringer
Collegedale, Tennessee
Dear Mr. Ringer:
The accounting book Intermediate Accounting by
Karrenback and Simons that Mr. VandeVere used
last year is not satisfactory for the class
this year due to the fact that the course has
been expanded into a six-hour course.
I understand a new text has been ordered. The
books on hand at present, Some already in the
hands of the students, should be disposed of.
Sincerely yours,
G. B. Shankel
Academic Dean
