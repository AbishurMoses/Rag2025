We will have several positions open at our academy for the coming sch
and are wondering if you have someone who will be certified to teach -
is interested in working with our young people.
We need someone to teach English and act as librarian and someone who
teach home economics and typingo The combination of any two subjects
probably be worked out, None of these classes are full-time work in 1
selves; therefore, we must have someone who could qualify in two areas
We have a very lovely, Christian school and at present are in our secc
year of operation. Our campus is very colorful, modern and has the le
equipment in all departments as everything is entirely new, We have E
student body and a good teaching personnel at presents
The pictures on the reverse side of this letter might be helpful in ob
ing a better idea of our school, We also have a ymasium-amditorium

of space.
