Dear Sir:
Our junior English class at Negaunee High School is
studying careers. We are gathering as much informa-
tion as we can on the field we are interested in, so
that we may write a research paper on it.
As I am seriously considering going into some field
of missionary work, I would appreciate very much if
you could send me any information you might have that
you think would interest and help me.
I would like to have this information at the earliest
convenient time. Thank you very much.
Yours in Christ,
marcea
Marcia Pascoe
