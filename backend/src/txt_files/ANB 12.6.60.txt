following action relative to endorsing notes of Collegedale
Cabinets, Inc., was voted:
"VOTED to approve a plan for financial assistance to the

tion are authorized to endorse on beha! 1f of the College notes

outstanding at any one time.
This action is intended to delete any mention of arrangements
