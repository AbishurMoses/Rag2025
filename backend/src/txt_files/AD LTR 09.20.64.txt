Dear Colleague:
Your request to attend the North American Division Educational
meeting to be held at Denver, Colorado was recently discussed by the
House Committee. It was felt that it would be impossible for us to
grant this request since ie would take you out of the teaching program
for over a week. Ie is also our understanding that attendance at this
meeting is by invitation only, therefore, we feel that fe would not be
proper for us to send those who have not been invited.
I trust that you will understand our position in this matter and that
you will be able to fiad local meetings that will be of value to you
professionally.
Sincerely yours,
J- w. Cassell, Jr.
Academic Dean
